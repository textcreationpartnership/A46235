            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Authors Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THree things there are (Studious Reader) which I am to inform thee of in this Preface: <hi>viz.</hi> of the Cauſe of my writing this Book; of the Structure or manner of its Fabrick; and of its
<pb facs="tcp:56003:4"/>uſe. I took this pains long ſince, only for my own private occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and now my being called to be publick Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Francfort,</hi> is the Cauſe that it appears upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stage of the world. For, ſeeing the Injuriouſneſs of the times would not ſuffer unto me to make it appear how much I valewed my Call to that Profeſsion, and what ardent deſire I had to advance the Studies of young Learners, by publick teaching; I have done both in this Book. Hereunto were added the earneſt deſires of certaine friends, who aſſured me great good would redound to young ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Phyſick by the publication thereof; and that though <hi>Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavellus, Fernelius, Pernumia, Petraeus, Bruel, Zacutus,</hi> had done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently wel; yet that ſome of them being over brief did not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the method of Cureing; others made little or no mention of the Prognoſtick ſigns; others were taken up with diſquiſitions; and ſome of them did not meddle with many diſeaſes. Moreover, they warned me not to ſuffer my ſelf to be terrified with any feare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions or calumnies. That ſuch as were void of all vertue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did render themſelves infamouſly famous among ſuch as themſelves, by detracting from others. That envious perſons vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of like good themſelves, did proſtitute their own fame by gnawing upon the glory of others, &amp;c. Touching the <hi>Structure,</hi> underſtand in ſhort, it was my deſire to bring into a ſmal compaſs, the Brief delination of al diſeaſes in a manner, with their ſigns, cauſes, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Cure; that the diligence of the forenamed Authors might be joined hereunto. Among Diſeaſes I thought fit to put <hi>external ones</hi> in the firſt place, both becauſe tis fit to begin with ſuch things as are beſt known to ſence: and becauſe tis thought the firſt practice of Phyſick that ever was, was converſant about them <hi>Chiron</hi> is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to have been the firſt Phyſitian that ever was, and had his name from the moſt excellent skil in Chyrurgery. I have marſhalled the Sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before the Cauſes, that I might aſsiſt the natural method of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conception, in the finding out of things, when this or that ſymptom is related, I enquire into other ſigns. The diſeaſe being known, I proceed to the variety of Cauſes. I have endeavored to reduce al to the Differences, both that the diſeaſe might be thereby more exactly known, and the diverſity of the Cure more accurately expreſſed. If you ſhal ask what <hi>Authors</hi> I follow? you may pleaſe to take notice, that I did long ſince Collect this Introduction to the Practice of Phyſick, out of the Volums of <hi>Daniel Sennertus,</hi> that moſt
<pb facs="tcp:56003:5"/>renowned Phyſitian; whoſe method and order I do now alſo, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neare in al things, follow. With him I have compared, <hi>Fernelius, Joel, Capivaccius, Liddelius, Aquapendens, Petraeus, Ferdinandus, Fabricius, Martinus, Collutius, Fracaſtorius, Fallopius, Quercetanus, Zacutus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitanus, Crucius, Platerus, Septalius, Heurnius, Ferrandus, Hochſtet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, Untzerus, Mynſichtus, Beckerus, Hart-mannus, Stockerus,</hi> and others; al which you ſhal find cited in their places. As for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, <hi>I</hi> have ſet down thoſe which <hi>I</hi> have found moſt highly commended, by the beſt Phyſitians. Nor have <hi>I</hi> concealed ſuch as in my Travels <hi>I</hi> have obtained from certain brave men, nor ſuch as <hi>I</hi> found in the Study of <hi>Mattheus Vechnerus</hi> of bleſſed memory, cheife Phyſitian to the King, and my Father in Law; ſuch a Phyſitian, as this Country of ours has hardly afforded his equal, and (which makes moſt of al to his praiſe) a man void of Diſsimulation, Boaſting, and pompous haughtyneſs of mind. And many times <hi>I</hi> have only poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Medicaments by naming them and their Authors, that <hi>I</hi> might thereby provoke young Students to read the ſaid Authors; and leaſt that if <hi>I</hi> ſhould have ſet them down at large, young perſons would have abuſed them by a dangerous preſumption. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Uſe,</hi> what it is, and when the ſtudent is to employ the ſame, <hi>I</hi> ſhal now ſpeak. As to the former, you have here an Introduction into thoſe vaſt works of <hi>Saxonia, Mercatus, Maſſaria, Capivaccius, Radius, Sennertus,</hi> touching the diſeaſes of Mans body. This work wil ſerve inſtead of a book of common-places, into which al that a man reads, may be referred, as to an Index; whether they be ſuch things as <hi>I</hi> have not touched, or ſerving to correct ſome error (for <hi>I</hi> beleeve <hi>I</hi> may eaſily have erred) enlargement, or clearing up of what is ſaid. As to the latter, the ſtudent of Phyſick is firſt to be wel read in the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Rules of the Art before he Practice. Alſo he is to have skil in the Nature of Plants, Minerals, Anatomy, and Chimiſtry. And this is that which <hi>I</hi> thought fit to acquaint thee with, Studious Reader.</p>

From whence it is that ſome have diſtinguiſhed and reduced them under theſe two Heads, viz. of things healthful, and unhealthful.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Preſcription</hi> is ſpoken to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in two parts. The <hi>former whereof</hi> enumerates and recounts thoſe things that are not Naturall; and declareth in what manner they affect Mans body. They commonly cal this part, <hi>Dietetical,</hi> in reference unto the diet that is obſerved. The <hi>other</hi> openeth the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of preſerving the health, by ſhewing us the way and means how we may ſo uſe theſe things not natural, that they may not, in the leaſt hurt or offend our bodies.</p>
               <p>Of Things not natural there are four ranks or Claſſes. The firſt containeth thoſe things that are taken and received into the Body. The ſecond, thoſe things in and about which the body is exerciſed. The third, ſuch things as happen unto the body from without.

                     <p>Touching this Air there are four things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.
<list>
                           <item>Firſt, that it is neceſſary to the very being of Health.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, That it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects mans body.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, That there are many differences thereof.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, That it is ſubject and Liable unto divers changes and alterations.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>And firſt of al, <hi>That it is neceſſary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite unto the very being and preſervation of health,</hi> (yea indeed ſo far forth neceſſary, that if any one intercept the ſaid paſſages of the Air into the body, it unavoidably periſheth in a moment or very ſhort time) appeareth even from hence, to wit, that unleſs the heart ſhould be cooled, and unleſs that the Internal fire or heat ſhould be ventilated and excited, and laſtly, unleſs the ſpirits ſhould continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be refreſhed and revived, a man could not poſſibly put forth, or exerciſe his Actions. Now the Air is therefore attracted by the Lungs, that it may qualify and temper the overgreat heat of the Heart. The ſame Air likewiſe by its motion (as it were with a Fan) ventilates &amp; cooles the internal heat, ſo that it not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more moderate, but is alſo thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and ſtirred up. And laſtly, the ſame aforeſaid Air being from without attracted inwardly by the rough Arteries (uſually termed <hi>aſperae</hi>) and firſt of al prepared and wrought upon in the very fleſh of the Lunges, and next of al in the Heart and Arteries (thoſe of them more eſpecially that are in the Netlike folding (we commonly cal it <hi>plexus retiformis</hi>) and laſt of al (moſt perfectly and exquiſitely) in the ventricles of the Brain, by its ſubſtance, generateth and produceth ſpirits.</item>

                              <item>Secondly, As it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates it ſelf into the ſame, whether it be by inſpiration, which is done either by the Mouth according to the taking in and putting forth of the breath; or by the Arteries, according to their dilatation and compreſſion: or otherwiſe by Tranſpiration, which is performed al the skin throughout, and in each part thereof by thoſe exceeding ſmal paſſages (not unlike unto thoſe of a very fine five) which the Greeks cal <hi>Porous,</hi> the Latines, <hi>poros;</hi> we in Engliſh pores.</item>

                              <item>I. In reſpect of its <hi>Quantity,</hi> it is copious, ſcant, ful, which laſt <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (in his tract of breathings or blaſts) cals <hi>athrooteron,</hi> that is to ſay, al at once and ſpeedily breaking in upon us.</item>
                              <item>II. In regard of its <hi>Quality,</hi>

                                    <item>1. <hi>Hot,</hi> and this augments the cholor, melts away the humors, weakens and hinders Concoction; and conſequently by diſſipating the Native heat it very much ſhortens the life.</item>
                                    <item>2. <hi>Cold,</hi> which by ſhutting the pores or paſſages of the skin, and ſo hindering perſpiration, excites putrid Feavers, or elſe by compreſſion cauſeth deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, forceth the Blood oftentimes out of the Veins, from whence proceed inflamations; and then it extreamly hardneth whatſoever is in the belly.</item>

                                    <item>4. <hi>Over dry,</hi> which (its true) waſts and conſumes the ſuperfluous humors; but again it breeds acute feavers through the abundant increaſe of ſharp humors; and it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exceedingly dryeth the skin.</item>
                                    <item>5. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> whether overmuch exceeds in the firſt qualities, or elſe is rendered impure by reaſon of vapors ariſing from Lakes, ſtanding waters, fenny and Mooriſh places; or elſe ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cleanſed and purified by the through blaſts of the wind.</item>
                                    <item>6. That which is the beſt, which is <hi>temperate in the firſt qualities,</hi> pure, ſubject to no infection or polution, ſeren, clear, ſweetly and gently ſtirred to and fro by frequent blaſts and gentle gales of winds, and which is often times moyſtened with wholſom and healthful ſhowers of rain.</item>

                              <item>III. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> it is,
<list>
                                    <item>1. Thick, which for the moſt part intercepts the very ſight, and hinders the proſpect, ſo that either we cannot at al diſcern the ſtarrs, or if we do, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us much leſs than at other times, or at leaſt as much darkned and overcaſt.</item>
                                    <item>2. Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or tempeſtuous, which hath divers of its thicker parts, (as it were made up of their moiſture) violently hurried amidſt the ſerene and cleer, by turbulent and tempeſtuous winds.</item>
                                    <item>3. Thin, which is contrary to the former, tranſparent, ſerene, free from vapors, and throughly cleanſed by the thorough blaſts of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56003:11"/>Windes.</item>
                                    <item>4. Putrid and rotten, whether it be that it putrefie of its own accord, as wanting ventilation, (as for inſtance) that which is on every ſide ſhut up, and as it were impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by high Mountains, or elſe that it becomes corrupted from ſome other cauſe, as ſuppoſe, from the Heavens, the Stars, the Winds blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from infected places, or from ſome noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome peſtilent vapor, &amp;c.</item>
                                    <item>5. Healthful and wholſome, which hath its original and its whol conſtitution from and under benign and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Climats, is ſtirred and driven to and fro by wholſom Winds, and is not in the leaſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated or corrupted by the vapors that proceed from any putrid and impure, whether things or places.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>Fourthly, The Air taketh its <hi>mutations</hi> or Changes (which <hi>Galen</hi> cals Alteration accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Conſtitution) from theſe ten things more eſpecially.
<list>
                              <item>Firſt, From the <hi>Stars</hi> and Conſtellations; for both the Planets, and likwiſe the fixed Stars have in them much of power and influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe inferior Bodies. Concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the former, we may at large read in <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> in the fourth Chap. of his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the Books of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> as touching the effects of the ſtars. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writes that moſt Women conceive at the ful of the Moon. Touching the latter, to wit, the fixed ſtars, it is eaſily to be ſeen, and manifeſtly perceived even in the leſſer Dog-ſtar alone, the <hi>Pleiades</hi> &amp; <hi>Arcturus.</hi> For upon the riſing of the Dog-Star the Seas grow tempeſtuous &amp; fluctuating, Wines work afreſh and fluctuate in the Cellers, Dogs run mad, and the like. At the Settling of <hi>Pleiades,</hi> great Tempeſts and North-eaſt Winds ariſe; and upon the Settling of <hi>Arctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ſtorms and Hail.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, From the <hi>different times of the year,</hi> as wel the greater, which by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians (in regard that they have in them the reaſon of the greateſt changes and alterations proceeding from the riſing and ſetting of the Stars of the firſt magnitude) are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under a ſeptenary or ſeven fold number; and are commonly reduced unto the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; as the leſſer, to wit, Monthes, Weeks, and Daies. For the Spring is hot and moiſt. The Summer hot and dry. Rhe Autumn cold and dry. The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cold and moiſt. The Qualities of the Monthes ought to be taken from the ſign of the Zodiack that rules, and hath as it were a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power in them. The qualities of the Weeks are derived from the Quarters of the Moon; of which the firſt is moiſt, the ſecond hot, the third dry, the fourth cold. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the daies from the parts thereof; of which the Morning part is in a manner ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the Noon part like unto the Summer, the Evening thereof reſembling the Autumn, and the night not unlike unto the Winter: howbeit there is in this but little of weight or moment, and therefore not much regard to be had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</item>
                              <item>Thirdly, <hi>From the Winds,</hi> and thoſe aſwel common, (of the which ſome are Anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as keeping their courſe at one certain time every year; as for inſtance, thoſe we cal <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidoniae, Eteſiae, and Prodromi,</hi> which two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are Winds blowing out of the Eaſt yearly, at one certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                    <item>3. That of the Septentrinal or Northerly Winds, (when they blow ſtrong) that which we cal <hi>Boreas</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ful North Wind) is the moſt vehement: thoſe that blow at the half point are next unto it; of thoſe that are Collateral, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that <hi>Boreas</hi> is more warm and moiſt than the Eaſterly wind <hi>Subſolanus:</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that <hi>Boreas</hi> is more cloudy than the Weſt Wind <hi>Favonius.</hi>

                              <item>Seventhly, From thoſe <hi>Regions</hi> of the World that are called the Cardinal Regions. For the Oriental Regions are indifferently tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and they have clear and pure waters, of a ſweet ſmel; and the inhabitants thereof are wel favoured, ſound, and their Women very fruitful. On the contrary, the Occidental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are extream ſickly and unhealthful; they have thick and muddy waters, and the people thereof are of an il color. The Meridional or Southerly Regions abound with ſtore of waters ſomwhat ſalt, ſublime, and they that inhabit in them are evermore ſubject to moiſt heads, and obnoxious to a flux or looſneſs of the Belly. The Setentrional or Northern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions have their waters harſh and cold; the people thereof are dry, long-liv'd, and of a tall ſtature. The Oriental Regions are more heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the Occidental, as wel becauſe the Sun it its vigor diſſolveth thoſe moiſt vapors that it drew up at the riſing thereof; as alſo in regard that it doth not only not diſſolve thoſe which al the day it hurrieth along with it ſelf towards the Weſt, but likewiſe that it excites and ſtirs up many more vapors in the Weſt, and ſo leavs them; as alſo becauſe that there many more vapors drawn up in the occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, than there are in the Oriental part of the World, in regard that there are in the Weſt far more and (thoſe) far greater Seas, than in the Eaſt.</item>

<list>
                                    <item>1. That places ſtanding high, enjoy a pure Air, as being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and purified by the winds that blow throw it; and therefore thoſe places produce and nouriſh ſtrong, luſty, and long lived inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by reaſon of the want and abſence of moiſt excrements.</item>
                                    <item>2. That ſteep down hil places depreſſed and (as it were) pend up between other mountaines, are in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time even ſuffocated with the reflexed ſun-beames; and in the winter (by reaſon of the ſuns abſence) are annoyed with overmuch moiſture, and thick, clouded vapours.</item>
                                    <item>3. Places that are plain, if ſo be they have on al ſides every thing fit about them, they have then no other property, but that which is taken from the obſervation of the Climates.</item>
                                    <item>4. Thoſe places that are rocky and open, in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have the Air hot, but in the winter cold, &amp; ſo thin and ſubtil, that almoſt no vapours can be elevated and drawen up out of rocks.</item>
                                    <item>5. Places Mountaineous and high are ſnowy, and therefore healthful by reaſon of their ſnows; but when theſe melt away, thoſe places becom very much clowded. Now if thoſe Mountains are ſituate to the North eaſt, then thoſe places wil be hot by reaſon of the reflected ſunbeams; but if to the ſouth, and that the winds blow from the North, then thoſe places by means of the ſnows and winds, are cold, dry, and ſound, unleſs ſomething elſe hinder. If to the Eaſt, then they are cold, becauſe they ruled and ſwayed by the Eaſt. Their Air is thick both in regard they are nigh unto Mountains, as alſo becauſe they lie open unto the Weſtern Winds. If they be ſituate to the Weſt they are therefore healthy in regard that they are then expoſed unto the oriential or Eaſtern winds.</item>
                                    <item>6. Thoſe places that are woody are infeſted with a thick, ſuffocated, cloudy and turbid Air: among the trees, the Nut tree and Oak are more eſpecially hurtful.</item>
                                    <item>7. Thoſe places that are neer adjoining unto rivers do moiſten overmuch.</item>
                                    <item>8. Such places as are fenny, and abound with lakes by reaſon of their filthy noyſom vapors are very apt to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate diſeaſes.</item>
                                    <item>9. Thoſe places that are nigh unto the ſea are thought to be healthful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ſaltneſs reſiſts corruption and the winds do evermore throughly purge the Air, &amp; becauſe likewiſe that the Sea in the Winter and in a cold Region renders the Aire warmer than ordinary; but on the other ſide (in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, and in a hot Country) it makes the Air exceeding temperate.</item>
                                    <item>10. <hi>Cardamus</hi> hath left it for a Truth unto us, that thoſe that are ful of hot Baths do viciate and corrupt the Air of the place, howbeit not ſo far forth that they hurt thoſe bodies that are ſtrong and able (which are not hot) by reaſon that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from putrifaction. But of theſe ſee (I pray) and read <hi>(next after Hippocrates) Renatus Morean</hi> learnedly and excellently diſcourſing of them in his Tract upon <hi>Schola Salernitana.</hi>

Its hurtful quality may be corrected, if we take it Boyled in fleſh Pottage. The Juyce thereof hath in it a tart Acrimonious quality, &amp; ſuch as excites and provoks the Belly to void its Excrements. That which hath its Leaves ſpread al abroad, is far wholſomer and better than that which groweth al of a Head, which for diſtinction ſake we cal the Cabbage.

By its extraordinary great heat and dryneſs it attenuates and cuts aſunder the thick Humors; and moreover it is a moſt exquiſite Remedy for the correcting of the pravity, of waters that are gotten together in the Abdomen or Belly, and a ſpecial help and means for the enduring of cold.</item>
                                    <item>3. The <hi>Leek,</hi> which hath almoſt the ſame properties and qualities with the Forementioned. It is chollerick, and greatly hurtful to ſuch as are of weak Brains; it duls the ſight of the eyes; and being often eaten it begets choler of a Greeniſh color much like unto the Leek it ſelf. If it be in the beginning of the meal Eaten raw with Salt, it then freeth the ſtomach and Belly from groſs and thick Juyces.</item>
                                    <item>4. The <hi>Reddiſh,</hi> which together with Salt we uſe to eat raw. But it is fitter to be uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſauce or ſallad, in regard it is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hot, and withal ſharp and tart, tiring and wearing out the Teeth. It collecteth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſcattered ſpirits, breaketh the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of the ſtomach by cauſing ructures or belchings, provoketh Urine, and expelleth the gravel out of the Kidneyes. That Garden Raddiſh is accounted the beſt which is brittle and eaſily broken. Unto the former may be added the wilde or horſe Raddiſh which hath in a manner the like vertues and properties with the Garden Raddiſh, and is more frequently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56003:14"/>made uſe of for a ſawce than for food, affording little or no Aliment.</item>
                                    <item>5. The <hi>Rape Root,</hi> which yieldeth nouriſhment enough, to wit, Hot, and moiſt; but then it is more ſlowly concocted (more eſpecially that which is raw) and puffeth up the Belly. It is ſomtimes kept until it be withered, and then made uſe of.</item>
                                    <item>6. The <hi>Navew</hi> or <hi>Turnep,</hi> which affordeth more Nutriment than the former, and hath in it leſs of the thick and flarulent Juyce than the Rape Root, provoketh luſt, and excites unto Venery.</item>
                                    <item>7. The <hi>Garden Parſnips;</hi> which yieldeth but little Aliment, and that likewiſe thick; and its Juyce is none of the beſt. It furthereth the Expulſion of Urine, ſtirs up Venery, and expels forth the Cauſes.</item>
                                    <item>8. The <hi>Red Beet,</hi> which being boyled or pickled up with Vinegar, Caraway Seed, and Horſe Raddiſh Root, is preſented and ſet upon the table in the place of a grand ſallad, rather than as a meat, ſince that it very little, or nothing at al nouriſheth.</item>

                                    <item>1. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichoke,</hi> which heateth and dryeth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree, is hard of Concoction, and the Juyce thereof none of the beſt. It is by ſome Eaten raw with Salt alone; but by others they are Boyled, and then they add thereto Pepper ſmal beaten, and Butter; if it be Eaten with Vinegar and Oyl it expels and drives forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Urine of a ſtinking Savor. There are ſome of Opinion, that it excites the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and reſtoreth it when weakened and wel nigh loſt.</item>
                                    <item>2. The <hi>Gourd,</hi> which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Aliment more than ordinary cold and moiſt, and therefore ſuch as is tranſient and ſtayeth not long in the body, but ſoon paſſeth throw. When it is corrupted in the ſtomach it is then converted into a very Malignant Juyce. Yet ſome there are that conceive theſe Gourds to be leſs dangerous and hurtful than Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They are oftentimes ſent to the table either roſted or fryed. The longer and leſſer of them are the more grateful, and indeed the more wholſome; ſuch as grow and increaſe after their hanging up, have in them but little or no Seed.</item>
                                    <item>3. <hi>Cucumbers;</hi> which are cold and dry. <hi>Galen</hi> was of Opinion that theſe were never to be allowed of, or admitted by men in their common Courſe of Diet; but that they were evermore to be baniſhed from their Meals, as moſt dangerous and baneful. For they abide unconcocted in the Stomach until the day following. Yet notwithſtanding they may not unfitly be Eaten (but they are rather thought to be very commodious and proper) if while they be yet green, and before they be ripe, you take them in ſalads, after they been a while kept in a Pickle made of Vinegar and Pepper, and they are then leaſt hurtful unto thoſe that have their ſtomack over hot. The Venetian Phyſitians preſcribe them againſt Peſtilential Diſeaſes by them to cut and divide the Humors.</item>
                                    <item>4. <hi>Melons,</hi> of al ſorts (but principally the Musk-Melon) which are both grateful to the Palate, and withal ſend forth an Aromatical or ſweet ſmel; but in regard that they abound with water from their Humidity, they are thereupon eaſily corrupted; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once corrupted they degenerate into a Poyſonous Nature, and thereby excite ſtore of Choler. And therefore they ought to be taken in the firſt beginning of Meals that ſo they may the more eaſily paſs through; and then we muſt be very careful to put nothing upon them but meats of a good Juyce, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter al to drink one draught or two of the beſt Wine.</item>
                                    <item>5. <hi>Straw-berries,</hi> which are moiſt and cold, of a thin Juyce, and ſuch as is ſoon and eaſily corrupted in the ſtomack. They cool the ſtomach and Liver when they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot and cholerick; they reſtrain and qualifie the heat of the Blood and Humors, allay the vehement thirſt, drives forth the Urine, and cleanſe the Reins. The beſt and fitteſt time to Eat them is in the beginning of the Meal. They are now and then Eaten with Cream and Sugar; but moſt uſually (as the better way of taking them) they are Eaten out of Wine.</item>
                                    <item>6. <hi>Capers,</hi> which if they be freſh and new, do the more effectually nouriſh, and looſen the belly. If they be eaten with vinegar and oyl they excite and Whet on the appetite unto a deſire after meat, they remove the obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, and carry forth that Flegm that is conteined within the Cavity of the Belly.</item>

Such of them as are ſharp and ſour are cold, and extreamly windy. Thoſe of them that are rough, harſh, and not Mellow, are of a thicker Juyce, and therefore defcend over ſlowly into, and through the belly, albeit the Force and ſtrength thereof was qualified and corrected by the firſt Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such of them as are wateriſh are of a moſt corrupt Juyce, and have no taſt at al in them.</item>
                                    <item>2. <hi>Quinces,</hi> which are cold and dry, of ſmal nouriſhment, and of hard digeſtion; if they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56003:15"/>be eaten raw they are very hurtful to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news; if they be taken in the beginning of the meal they render the belly Coſtive, if after meat, then they looſen the belly, and ſhut the mouth of the ſtomach.</item>
                                    <item>3. <hi>Oranges,</hi> which if ſowr they are uſually put into ſauces, and being therewith mingled they are of ſingular uſe, both for the ſtirring up of the appetite, and for the removal of the ſtomachs nauſeouſneſs and loathing: but if ſweet they are not then to be ſqueezed into ſauces and ſo eaten with other meats; but how ever we uſe them they are of ſingular bennefit in helping Coughs, and eaſing the jaws when exaſperated and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</item>

                                 <item>2. <hi>Snow and Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> which becauſe the moſt ſubtile and light parts are diſſipated, is thick, and hurts the ſtomach, and breeds greivous diſeaſes, of the joints, nerves and bowells.</item>

                                    <item>1. That we muſt not eat much and often, as the champions of old were wont to doe; becauſe that is good neither for the body nor the minde.</item>
                                    <item>2. It is better to eat often and a little, than much at once: for ſo neither ſhal the ſtomach be oppreſſed, nor the body Pined.</item>
                                    <item>3. So often at our pleaſure, as we feel our ſelves hungry. Now this varies, according to age, Temperament, kind of Life, cuſtome; yet the moſt healthy courſe for ſuch as are exerciſed with moderate labours is to eate twice a day; hard labours may eat four times a day. Nor muſt we eat, as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we feel our ſelves hungry, nor muſt we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer too long after Hunger ſummons us. For the former breeds crudities, the orifice of the ſtomach being provoked by reaſon of its exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſence of feeling; the latter fils the ſtomach with bad humors.</item>
                                    <item>5. Cholerick perſons, lean people, ſuch as uſe much exerciſe, muſt feed often. For the former doe eaſily faint away through faſting; eſpecially if choler be ſhed out into their ſtomach. The latter have their bodies apt to tranſpire and ſpend. The over exerciſed doe diſſipate much.</item>
                                    <item>6. To cold and moiſt perſons, to fat and corpulent, ſuch as are buſyed with little or indifferent labours, leſs meat is to be given, for the contrary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A Temperate man may eat twice a day.</item>
                                    <item>8. Becauſe al the meat is not digeſted in the ſtomach at one and the ſame time; but one part deſcends into the guts before another, there needs no ſuch ſubtile enquiry about the ſpace of time which muſt goe betweene dinner and ſupper; Provided there be no manifeſt ſigns of Crudity and repletion, the ſupper may be foure, five, or ſix houres after dinner.</item>
                                    <item>9. We muſt ſo keep to an houre of eating, that we ſometime tranſgreſs the ſame, leaſt exact cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome may occaſion ſome danger, when we are forced to miſs our time.</item>

Becauſe al meats are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to chyle, and thoſe that are fooneſt digeſted, are drawn by the Liver, ſpleen, and guts; it matters not with reference to Coction and generation of Chile, in ſuch as are in Health, what meats are eaten firſt and what laſt; yet it is beſt to take liquid meats before thoſe that are ſollid, becauſe they are ſooner reduced into act, and by their fermentation doe help the Coction of the other meats; alſo to take laxative meats before ſuch as are binding, if the mouth of the ſtomach be not looſe beneath, leſt being retained long in the ſtomach they bind the belly; ſuch meats as are apt to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt muſt be taken before others, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſtomach being looſened, they may the more eaſily paſs away: aſtringents before Laxatives, if the retentive faculty of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be weake.</item>

<list>
                              <item>1. We muſt drink ſo much, that our meat do not ſwim in our ſtomachs. Moderate drink moiſtens the body, cheriſhes the ſpirits, helps the diſtribution of meat, &amp;c. Overmuch drownes the heat of the body, breeds cruditie, diſturbs the mind.</item>
                              <item>2. We muſt drink between whiles at our meals, and we may drink after meat, if our meat paſs not eaſily out of the ſtomach; but not til digeſtion is over. If you drinke during your digeſtion, Coction is troubled, and the meate is drawn crude unto the Liver.</item>
                              <item>3. We muſt not drink faſting: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it weakens the nerves.</item>
                              <item>4. It is moſt convenient to drink a little and often at meals, than to fetch al off at a draught or two: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56003:29"/>manner quenches thirſt, the latter breeds fluctuation in the ſtomach. But ſee touching dinners and ſuppers <hi>Bernhardus Paternus,</hi> and <hi>Stuckius</hi> in his firſt book of the Feaſts of the ancients, Chap. 14.</item>

<list>
                              <item>1. Leane perſons muſt be moderarly moved, ſtrong perſons ſtrongly, reſpect being had to cuſtome; touching which <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſed to daily labours, although they are weak and old, do more eaſily undergoe their daily labours, than perſons unaccuſtomed, though ſtrong and yonge.</item>
                              <item>2. While a man is hungry, or meat remains undigeſted upon his ſtomach, he muſt not labor, for if he doe, the nouriſhment wil be drawn undigeſted into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the body: but he muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue too long faſting neither, for then, the natural heat wil be deſſipated, and bad humors wil be brought into the ſtomach.</item>
                              <item>3. Motion muſt goe before and follow after eating, but ſuch as is light. The former removes ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements as ſtick in the narrow paſſages; the latter, brings down the meat, into the bottom of the ſtomach.</item>
                              <item>4. Thoſe whoſe head is weak or ful, muſt not walke in the Sun.</item>

                              <item>7. A man muſt not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſently after meat, leaſt the heat be called forth of the ſtomach, and the brain be filled with vapours.</item>

Nor is ſleep in the day time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, unleſs a man have paſſed the greateſt part of the night without ſleep, otherwiſe the Head wil be filled with vapours. Alſo that ſleepe is not allowable which is after Sun-riſe, which by its beames opens the paſſages of the body, and cals forth the humors and ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its from the Centre to the Circumference: as for the manner of lying in bed, it ought to be upon one ſide, begining on the right, that the ſtomaches digeſtion may be aſſiſted by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the thighs and armes being moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly contracted, the head a little high, the reſt of the body as ſoftly repoſed as may be. As for the place, the moon-beames muſt be avoided: Let the bed be ſoft, fit to keepe off the injuries of the aire. Whether the Head ſhould be covered or no, I leave as a thing doubtful.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Touching Baths, obſerve theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rules.
<list>
                              <item>1. They ought to be neither fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent nor long; for they diſſipate natural heat, and cauſe a redundancy of il humors.</item>
                              <item>2. We muſt not goe into the bath, before our meat be digeſted, leaſt crudities be drawn into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</item>
                              <item>3. We muſt not eat nor drink in a bath.</item>
                              <item>4. We muſt come out of the bath before we we be weary, nor muſt we eate or drink, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heat be expired.</item>
                           </list>
Concerning waſhing of the head and feet, I ſhal only ad, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. The former is not good in Head-ach, or Catarhs; in other caſes, it opens the pores, and lets out fumes: the latter drawes humors from the Head.</p>

            <p>Its <hi>End</hi> therefore is to remove (if poſſible) the preternatural Diſpoſitions of the body, and to reſtore health loſt.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Parts</hi> are likewiſe two: 1. <hi>General,</hi> which treats of the Nature, Signs, Cauſes, Differences and Cure of the praeternatural Affections of the Body, both in General, in particular, &amp; in Conjunction. 2, <hi>Special,</hi> which treates of ſuch preternatural affections as refer to the particular parts of the Body.

                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>times</hi> are four.

The <hi>ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is judged, both by its natural Cauſes, as wel <hi>immediate,</hi> viz. the natural Conſtitution of the parts, in Temper, Conformation, and unity: as <hi>mediate,</hi> or remote, viz. the ſix non-natural things ſo called: as alſo by its effects, viz. the Actions, evacuations, and qualities changed. The ſtrength of the diſeaſe is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, from things eſſentially inherent, cauſes external and internal, helpers, and effects, or conſequences thereof. Here note.

                           <hi>Point, 1.</hi> Concerning Humor's offending in Quantity, or a Plethora ſo called.</head>
                        <p>THe firſt kind of internal Cauſes are the Humors: and they are wont to offend in <hi>Quantity, Quality, Motion, Place,</hi> and in their <hi>whole ſubſtance: Humors offending in Quantity are termed Plethora, which is nothing elſe but a ſuperabundance of Humors fit to nouriſh the Body, which ariſe from their Cauſes.</hi> Humors nouriſhing the body of man are contained in the maſs of blood, viz. <hi>Blood, Cholor, Flegm, and Melancholly.</hi> Theſe being turned into the ſubſtance called cambium, do nouriſh ſuch parts as are of kin to themſelves and communicate to them as much health as themſelves are Maſters of. The <hi>ſigns</hi> of Plethora are, wearyneſs; becauſe the blood not being ventilated ſettles into the lower parts. Thick breathing after very ſmal Labor, the Muſcles of the Cheſt being laden with blood. Swelling of the veins, Diſtenſion of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, carnoſity of the Bodies habit, Deep ſleeps, ruddyneſs of the face, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are, good nouriſhment which affords good juice. The Liver hot and moiſt which makes it. Idleneſs, evacuations ſtopt, cutting off of ſome member. Uſe of unwonted bathings after meate.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are,
<list>
                              <item>I. One is <hi>Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,</hi> when either al the Humors are encreaſed, keeping their due proportion and equality, viz, ſo that the blood be in a double propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to flegm, and flegm double to cholor; or only blood alone; or two or three of the reſt exceed, blood alſo not keeping its proportion. 'Tis <hi>knowen</hi> by the ſigns forementioned. It ariſes alſo from the cauſes aforeſaid. Another is <hi>baſtard</hi> when plenty of bad juices, is joined with abundance of the natural humors. 'Tis <hi>knowen</hi> by the ſigns of a Plethora, joined with thoſe of a cacochimia, and it ariſes from the cauſes of both.</item>
                              <item>II. One is termed <hi>ad vaſa,</hi> or in reſpect of the veſſels; which does not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſtrength, becauſe it increaſes equally with the fleſh &amp; blood; but it diſtends the coates of the veſſels by its plenty, to which the things aforeſaid agree. Another <hi>ad viſis,</hi> when the Humors ſo encreaſe, that they cannot be governed nor digeſted by the feeble ſtrength of the Patient. 'Tis knowen hereby, that the blood is not very good, there is heavineſs and Inequality of the pulſe, with ſigns of crudity, and putrefaction beginning.</item>

               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Adulteration,</hi> has chiefly place in out landiſh drugs, as <hi>Champhire</hi> brought from Borneum, is adulterated with fragments of ſtones or a certaine gum called chambderros, like crude ambar, or the duſt of a certaine wood. So <hi>Bezar-ſtone</hi> is many waies counterfeted. Moſch is mixed with a certatine ſtuf made of Goats blood, bread toaſted and poudered, and the gum Ladanum. <hi>Amber-Greſe</hi> is made up of the pouder of Lignum Aloes. <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is counterfeted, by barks of Tamariske ſteeped in Cinnamon water and then dried. <hi>Benzoin or Benjamin,</hi> by a mixture of Roſin, oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, and a little ſtorax. <hi>Opobalſamum</hi> with Oile of Liquid ambar. <hi>Opium</hi> with Meconium.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The occaſion of <hi>ſubſtitution,</hi> or uſeing Quid pro quo, is the want of ſome ſimples.

                     <head>Article. II. <hi>Of Bathes</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bathes are hot waters, which bubble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually out of the Earth, are heated by the Subterranan fire, and having gained Vertue from divers Minerals, they cure Diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitly uſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. They are <hi>hot</hi> either at their Head, or in their Chanels; either more or leſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. They <hi>leap and bubble out of the Earth,</hi> becauſe they have their Riſe in an high Place, either in Mountains, or at the foot of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as experience ſhews. They <hi>bubble up perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, for the moſt part,</hi> becauſe the Earth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moiſt, and the ſubterraneal Heat does alwaies carry up vapors to the Concavities of Mountains, which where they cannot exhale, they are condenſed, compreſſed, and turn into drops of water. Yet bathes are found, which riſe &amp; fal with the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. Nor do they alwaies flow out at one place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſectet paſſages are either deſtroyed or ſtopped up.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>Heat</hi> of Bathes comes from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal fire, which is kindled by an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hot exhalation, thin and enflamed, getting among the Sulphur and Bitumen, by which it is fed. Either the waters run through thoſe hot ſubterranean places, or in the way they are joined to the flames and Heat; or they run ſo long above or by the Channels, til they grow hot; or whiles the Earth grows hot by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground fires, many vapors are from thence rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which being at laſt, in ſome wide place tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to water, they do in one place or other ſeek an out-gate: or laſtly, two or more metalline waters, being naturally cold to the touch, do in their converſe grow hot through repugnancy of their Spirits; an example whereof we have in ſpirit of vitriol, and oyl, or ſalt of Tartar, alſo in <hi>Aquafortis</hi> and Tartar, in Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſpirit of Nitre.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Subterranean matters which virtuate the Bathes,</hi> are divers: partly minerals, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mettals; which may be gathered from the ſeveral Bathes. Now how that comes to paſs, and how the Materials in them may be known, I ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The <hi>Diſeaſes that are cured by them,</hi> are alſo various, the Colick, Mother-fits, Stone,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56003:43"/>Barrenneſs, Headache, &amp;c. Some of which they cure directly, others by accident.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>They are uſed to drinke,</hi> for which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they are bad, which have ſome hurtful metalline property in them; alſo to bathe, Foment, in ſtoves, and by application of their clay: of al which ſee beſides <hi>Fallopius, Horſtius and Rulandus</hi> in Balnearium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauratum.</p>

Such a true and ſingle indicant, is neither the diſeaſe, nor its cauſe, nor any Symptom; but the ſtrength, virtue and faculty of a body cureable, or the virtue and faculty ſanative in a body ſanable, and that active, which is naturally moved to health, as to its perfection. <hi>Not the Diſeaſe:</hi> For that is the primary indicant to which al things are referred; the ſame is the Condition of Ends and indicants. But the Phyſitian does al for Healths, and not for the diſeaſes ſake. The indicant is permanent in the body. But the diſeaſe does not ſtay, without its own Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal Cauſe. To the indicant we owe an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe it indicates for its own ſake. But a diſeaſe not for its own, but healths ſake, &amp;c. <hi>Not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56003:60"/>the Cauſe,</hi> for it is not every kind of helpe, but a curative help which we ſeek after. The Cauſe as it intends the corruption of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cannot indicate or hint any thing but the corruption thereof. <hi>Not the Symptom,</hi> becauſe it abides not. The <hi>Forces of the Body are the only and primary indicant;</hi> For you muſt firſt conſider the Forces and ſtrength of the Body, before you ſet upon the Cure. Lighter diſeaſes are to be committed to Nature; dangerous ones and ſuch as are towards their Criſis, are not to be tampered with; deſparate ones admit no cure. The <hi>forces</hi> of the body muſt not be quite dejected and worſted, for then nothing is indicated; nor yet <hi>luſty and ſtrong,</hi> for then they can do al of themſelves. Oft times nature brings the morbifick matter through the middle of a bone, and makes an impoſthume, caſts out the ſanies of the lungs, by urine or ſtoole, expells the ſtopt courſes by the Eyes, the holes of the teeth the toes of the feet, &amp;c. But they are the <hi>tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> forces of the body, which require help, and conſequently indicate.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Indicatum</hi> or Remedy hinted, is that which ought to help the diſeaſed body; ſafely without danger of a relapſe or injury to the body; pleaſantly without nauſeouſneſs and overmuch trouble; and quickly without any delay. Touching which obſerve,
<list>
                     <item>1. That none reduces health by its own proper force, but by the Aſſiſtance of the inbread Heat, or nature it ſelf, ſo that Nature does the work properly and formally, the remedy only as her inſtrument or Handmaid.</item>
                     <item>2. That it is not contrary to a diſeaſe, if it be ſimply conſidered as an Entity of ſuch or ſuch a nature: but it is contrary, as it is joined to an animate body, and actuated by nature. Yet not primarily and of its own nature, but obliquely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily; both becauſe it aſſailes the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe with forces which are not connatural to it; alſo becauſe vomiting is often cured by vomiting, looſeneſs of the Belly by purging, ſtifneſs of the whole body called <hi>Tetanus,</hi> by throwing cold water thereupon; and finally; becauſe diſeaſes are likewiſe commonly cured by their cauſes. So worms are killed by the pouder of worms, the flux of arterial blood by ſome drop of blood drunken, or the pouder of dried blood ſprinkled on.</item>

                     <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of the Additional Method.</head>
                  <p>SO much for the Method of healing in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: the ſpecial Methods follow, and they are Additional and Abſtractive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Additional Method, is that which ſupplies as much as is wanting in the powers of nature, by Augmentation and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. It is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> becauſe, ſeeing no diſeaſe happens but the faculty of the body is hurt: yea &amp; the form of ſickneſs conſiſts in the inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to act, ſo that the ſaid inability being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the form likewiſe of the diſeaſe is reduced to the habit of Health.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>Indicant</hi> in this Method, is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native or healing Principle in the Patient; which is neither the <hi>Soul,</hi> becauſe that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies like it ſelf ſubject to no violence or hurt of ſickneſs: nor the <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe that is meerly paſſive, and indifferently diſpoſed to ſickneſs or health; but it is <hi>the innate Heat,</hi> which is rightly tearmed the true, proper, and immediate ſubject, wherein the curing faculty reſides. For by it, verily, the parts do live and act. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals it the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Warmth, and implanted Heat, and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> terms it the Soul of Man, which is alwaies produced and removed even to his Death. This tempers and tunes the whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and moderates al the offices and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof; reduces al exceſſes to a geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportion, and ſuch an equability as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to Nature; and becauſe it congregates and collects things homogeneal and ſeparates things heterogeneal, therefore it ripens al cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, ſeperates al impurities, and tempers and unites the dry with the moiſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Indicatum,</hi> the thing <hi>Indicated</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in this Method, is ſomwhat that is like and familiar to the Indicant. Like wil to its like, and cleave to it, but a thing diſagrees and ſeparates from its unlike. Now this Remedy according to the definition of <hi>Petraeus,</hi> is a ſpiritual Quinteſſence, that is to ſay, a certain moſt thin, and moſt ſubtile and delicate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it were of a middle nature between matter and form, Soul and Body, and that different from the Elements and their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, perfuſed with a Caeleſtial Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>abſtractive</hi> Method is conſidered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in general or in ſpecial. <hi>Conſidered in general, it teaches us to free the ſanative Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Body from al Impediments, and to advance it into action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. The <hi>Indicant</hi> in this Method, is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mans body wanting health, hindred and provoked: from which the Cauſes and Diſeaſes are to be taken away. The End is their removal.</p>

                  <p n="2">II.

As for what concerns the <hi>Differences.</hi> Either the fault is <hi>original,</hi> or through defect of matter neceſſary to generation; or through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the natural faculty, which ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, retain, and elaborate the matter; and ſo it cannot be reſtored. Or after birth: by cutting, gnawing, putrefaction, refrigerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the <hi>Cure</hi> is to be directed to its cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>A Diſeaſe of Number in Exceſs, is when there is a thing which naturally ought not to be preſent.</hi> The <hi>Cure</hi> requires the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the ſaid thing, which according to the variety of the things to be removed, muſt be various leſt other parts be hurt, or that they may be hurt as little as may be; it is not to be applied to ſuch things as do not trouble a man. If you conſider the <hi>differences,</hi> The thing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous is either wholly againſt nature, as Stones, Wormes, &amp;c. and then the Cure is to be applied to them: or ſome <hi>entire ſubſtance,</hi> which ariſes either through over great plenty of maſter, and the weakneſs of the formative faculty in the firſt ſhaping of the Child, or by reaſon of of ſome vitious quality afterwards.

                  <p>A <hi>Diſeaſe of ſituation or connexion, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſuch parts of the Body as ought to be conjoined, and a conjunction of ſuch as ought to be ſeparated.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> conſiſt in thoſe things by means of which the parts are faſtened together, and touching luxation, we ſhal ſpeak in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Article. Now the connexion of ſuch things as ought to be ſeparate, comes to paſs when the intermediate parts are looſned, or the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments broken, or wounded. The <hi>Cure</hi> requires the Conjunction of parts disjoined, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of parts conjoined.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe <hi>luxations</hi> are moſt frequent of al the diſeaſes of ſituation: I think it meet in this place, to treat of <hi>Luxation</hi> in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are, the unlikeneſs of the Member to it ſelf as it was before, in ſhape and length; Motion hurt; pain, by reaſon of Compreſſion of the Nerves, Muſcles, and tendons; the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that part, in to which the joint is ſlipt; the hollowneſs of that place from whence 'tis fallen.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. One ſort ſprings from <hi>external Cauſes,</hi> a blow, a fal, violent extention before child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and at the time of the birth: which ought to be prevented. Another from <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> when an humor ſlipt into the Cavity of the Joynt, drives it from its ſeat.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is <hi>Perfect,</hi> when the whol Joynt is fallen out of its place, which is termed <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arthrema.</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. Another is with <hi>Inflamation and Pain,</hi> in which caſe, the pain muſt firſt be mitigated, the Inflamation aſſwaged; leſt by diſtention of the Nervs a Convulſion ariſe; and afterwards it muſt be replaced.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Another is accompanied with a <hi>Wound</hi> which is the moſt dangerous, eſpecially if the wound be nigh the Joynt, and an accute fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ariſe. Here, the Joynt, is forthwith to be reſtored to its place, if poſſible. If it cannot be reſtored, we muſt attend the Cure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation to the ſeventh or ninth day.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Another is with a fracture, where the Joynt is firſt to be reſtored to its place, and the Fracture is to be cured afterwards: if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repoſed, it is then to be reſtored, when the Callus is bred.</p>

                  <p>SIGNS are needleſs in ſuch as are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: the Internal may eaſily be gathered from the particulars.

At the <hi>Augment</hi> the Symptomes are encreaſed, the Sanies begins to be digeſted, and is leſſened in quantity; al things are greateſt in the <hi>State;</hi> in the declination they are leſs.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is either <hi>external,</hi> viz.

                  <p>The CURE is <hi>difficult</hi> if it reach to ſome noble parts of exquiſite ſenſe, ful of moiſture naturally. If it follow other diſeaſes, becauſe then nature drives the vitious humors to that part. If the Ulcer be great, becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal air can work ſtrongly upon it: If it be round, becauſe the extremities are more hardly reunited. If it be old; becauſe the bone muſt needs corrupt. If it tend to look green and black, for ſo the Heat of the part affected is extinguiſhed. If it run with much ſanies, thin, pale, lead-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor'd, black, and ſtinking.

                              <item>2.

                  <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of Fractures are ſundry.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One is athwart, ſo as the Extremities do not at al ſtick together. 'Tis <hi>known</hi> by this, in that you may feel the ends of the broken bone aſunder one from another, and in the place of the Fracture a nonnatural Cavity is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56003:74"/>&amp;c. <hi>'Tis more eaſily healed,</hi> eſpecially if it be ſimple and equal, and the broken bones be not removed out of their places.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another is when a bone is broken into divers parts. This is <hi>hardly</hi> Cured, eſpecially if ſharp eminences or points do prick the parts adjoyning. If they cannot be reduced to their former ſtate, and the member is become ſhorter and unfit for ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Another is <hi>according to the length</hi> of the Bone, which is called a <hi>Clift.</hi> This is known by the preternatural thickneſs of the member. 'Tis <hi>eaſily cured</hi> becauſe there is no need of any laborious replacing of Bones; but it ſuffices that the gaping Chinkt or Rift of the bone be cloſed up.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Another is <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Another is <hi>old,</hi> which is hardly; becauſe Inflamation being added, extenſion is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. The extremity of the Bones grow hard. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies, if the Cure be protracted beyond the ſeventh day, there is danger that the bone wil be blaſted.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Another is <hi>alone,</hi> of which al that has bin hitherto ſaid, muſt be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Another is with <hi>concluſion of the fleſh,</hi> and has a wound joyned therewith. This is dangerous, if the wound be great, and in the greater Muſcles; inflamations eaſily ariſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; the ſplints and other things for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repoſe thereof, cannot ſo wel be fitted; but an hole muſt be kept open for the Wounds.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Another, which happens in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Bone,</hi> and then the diviſion is lighter.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Another which is <hi>near the Head above</hi> or <hi>beneath;</hi> and then becauſe in the former there are more nerves, in the latter more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, greater pain happens.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Another is <hi>near the Joynt;</hi> and then by ligaments, nerves, tendons, the part broken cannot be conveniently bound up; in a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs part the Heat is weak; the motion of the member is hindered, by reaſon of a Callus or hard ſubſtance, which binds up the tendons or muſcles.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Another is, when <hi>Two Bones joyn'd together are broken,</hi> as in the Arm the Radius or Ulna: and then the Cure is hard.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Another when <hi>One,</hi> and then the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles can be leſs contracted, becauſe they are kept ſtretched by the whol Bone.</p>

               <p n="1">I. One is of <hi>Action hurt,</hi> whether it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, diminiſhed, depraved, or augmented. It comes to paſs, either through fault of the <hi>Faculty,</hi> when the immediate inſtrument is ill affected; to which the Abſence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Influent Heat is referred: or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome external <hi>Error,</hi> when thoſe things deceive, with which the actions are performed, or at leaſt, without which they cannot be. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is of <hi>Things voided,</hi> and <hi>things retained.</hi> Another of Qualities changed, which depend upon the Hurts of Actions; and the Humors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereupon.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Others are Symptomes of the <hi>natural Faculty,</hi> viz. the Nutritive, Augmentative, Generative, Retentive, Attractive, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, Expulſive. Others are of the <hi>vital Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;</hi> others of the <hi>animal Faculty,</hi> to which belong Symptomes of the external Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of the internal Sences, of the motive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The CURE of Symptomes, is their <hi>Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> or aſſwagement, and that muſt be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when they are urgent, that is to ſay, do threaten ſo great danger, that we cannot ſtay to take away the Diſeaſe, or its Cauſes, upon which they depend; but if we ſhould wait, danger of death, or ſome great Inconvenience would threaten us.

                  <p n="1">I. One kind of pain comes from <hi>an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſudden alteration of quality,</hi> which is taken away, by the remedies of a contrary quality. And it <hi>comes</hi> either from <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>dryneſs:</hi> then the cauſes have preceded, the pained part is red, we muſt go to work with things cold and moiſt. Or from <hi>cold &amp; dryneſs.</hi> the ſuitable Cauſes have preceded. The skin is white or growes black and blew by binding. 'Tis eaſed with things hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Another ſprings from <hi>Solution of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi> which is cauſed either by <hi>many humors,</hi> which ſtretch; ſharp ones which fret; in which caſes, bleeding and purgations are uſeful.

                  <p>Another is a pain, <hi>as of ſome heavy thing which burthens,</hi> which is commonly felt in the kidnies, ſometimes in the Liver and ſpleen. Another is a <hi>ſtretching paine, according to the longitude of the part,</hi> proper to the Nerves, which extends it ſelf into both parts of the Nerves.

                     <p>
                        <hi>An Inflamation is a Preternatural ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the fleſhy parts, ſpringing from blood which beſides the intent of Nature flows into the ſaid parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNES are, <hi>Heat,</hi> which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed partly by reaſon of the Blood, partly by the ſtoppage of the pores ſpringing from plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and thickneſs of blood, which ſtoppage wil not ſuffer the Fuliginous Vapors to exhale; and partly by the bloods putrefaction. <hi>Pain,</hi> both by reaſon of the diſtemper, and the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of continuity, cauſed by plenty of blood, filling and diſtending the part. <hi>Redneſs,</hi> the blood communicating its color to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. <hi>Tenſion</hi> or <hi>Stretching,</hi> becauſe of the abundance of blood diſtending the whol ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Part. <hi>Renitency</hi> or <hi>Tightneſs,</hi> from the ſame Cauſe. <hi>Pulſation</hi> by reaſon of the diſtention of the inflamed parts, cauſed by the heaving of the Artery, which wants freedom of roome to move it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, the plenty of blood, or its ſharpneſs by reaſon of Chollerick Humors; which becauſe they provoke Nature, they are by her thruſt out, ſhe uſing the blood as her Vehicle or Chariot to ride in, which flowes plentifully to the part, by reaſon of its pain. The <hi>Manner of its Breeding,</hi> is this. An <hi>Hot</hi> Fluxion, cauſing the blood to fal into the Muſcles, firſt the great Veins, then the leſſer, then the leaſt of al are diſtended. And when the fluxion can be in them no longer contained, it partly ſweats through the Coats of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which have alſo their pores; and is partly ſent out of the ſmal Orifices of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Veins, which open themſelves into the ſubſtance of the part, and ſhed into the empty ſpaces, which are between the firſt bodies or Particles; whence the parts gather Heat.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is performed.

                     <p>The SIGNES are a ſtif ſwelling that yeilds not to the touch, with redneſs, pain, and a ſlight fever.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is Blood ſlipt into the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, together with a vitious Humor provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Nature to expulſion.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>Doubtful,</hi> when they ripen ſlowly, becauſe they may turn to dangerous fiſtulaes.

                     <p>The SIGNS are drawn from the manner of its Riſe.

                  <p>Touching the <hi>Signs</hi> tis needleſs to ſpeak, ſeeing burning is manifeſt of it ſelf. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is either <hi>Fire, Scalding water, Oyl</hi> or <hi>melted metal</hi> or <hi>Fat</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Cure</hi> varies according to the differences In the <hi>firſt place,</hi> the fire muſt be fetcht out.

A Mucilage of Quince-ſeeds, Extracted with Roſe-water, and mixed with Line-ſeed Oyl, muſt be uſe at the beginning, which wil ſatiſfie al Indications.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of burnings are Vatious.</p>
                  <p n="1">I.

At laſt the Scarf-skin comes off. Tis <hi>Cured.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By taking out the fire, that no Puſtles may ariſe.</hi> Which is performed, either by ſteeping the Member in hot water, or by Application of a Linne Cloath wet in Lie, or Application of Onions beaten in a Mortar with ſalt; which nevertheleſs, is not good for burns in the Eyes.

Puſtles ariſe, wherein is contained a thin ſubtile water of a yellowiſh color, the Patient complaines his skin is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tis <hi>Cured.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. By <hi>Cutting</hi> the <hi>Puſtles,</hi> that the hot and ſharp Humor may flow out.</item>

                  <p>THe third kind of External Diſſeaſes are <hi>Fractures of bones;</hi> which are either <hi>more</hi> or leſe frequent. To the more frequent ſort belong.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Fractures of the <hi>Brachium</hi> viz. that Bone which is between the Elbow and the wriſt; which if it happen in <hi>both the bones,</hi> ſeeing they have no propor ſtay, and the neighboring parts are eaſily hurt, it is the more dangerous: if in <hi>one,</hi> and that the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt which needs leſs extenſion, it is leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: if in the <hi>nethermoſt,</hi> it is ſo likewiſe becauſe the Elbow ſerves for a ſtay; and a ſwathing band is more ſafely hung on.

It grows together within the ſpace of thirty daies.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Of the <hi>Humerus</hi> or <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> whoſe bone being great, and requiring long time to breed a Callus, it is forty daies in growing together.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Of the <hi>Crus</hi> or that part which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the knee to the foot. In which either Both bones are broken; and the whole leg may be bowed in: or the <hi>Tibia</hi> or ſhank bone, and the whol bone, as in a place without fleſh, may eaſily be ſeene. And it is cured with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulty, ſeeing there is need of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.

                  <p n="1">I. The <hi>Noſe,</hi> which is either equally flatted, ſo as to make a ſaddle-Noſe; or it is broke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>the one ſide:</hi> or it is writhen aſide by the <hi>Griſtle:</hi> or the <hi>bones</hi> thereof are <hi>broke</hi> into <hi>ſmal fritters.</hi> There is Joyned, ſomtimes a wound, and ſomtimes and Ulcer is raiſed within the Noſtrils. Unleſs the Noſe be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rectified, it muſt for ever remain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Of the lower <hi>Jaw-bone,</hi> whoſe bone is either broken ſo athwart, that the <hi>Bones ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs do in ſome meaſure hold together:</hi> or ſo, that <hi>one bone ſticks out above another,</hi> and one tooth ſticks out beyond another. They are conſolidated within twenty dayes, unleſs Inflamation happen. Alſo the teeth remain ſound,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> or channel bone, which is broken either athwart, and is eaſily reduced into its natural ſeat by extending and compreſſing the ſame with a mans fingers: or <hi>long-waies,</hi> which has alwaies ſome Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, which can hardly be brought into order. Its fracture is knowne by the touch and by the pian. It is ſoddered together within the ſpace of twenty daies.</p>
                  <p n="4">IIII. Of the <hi>Scapula</hi> and that either <hi>in respect of</hi> the <hi>ſhoulder tip.</hi> and then Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is perceived, if the hurt part be compared with the ſound or in <hi>respest</hi> of the <hi>broad part</hi> Then a certain cavity is perceived by the touch. the Arme juſt againſt it, is benummed.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56003:85"/>and nerves which ſpring from the Vertebraes of the Neck.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Of the <hi>Breſt-bone,</hi> whoſe fracture is known, by the bones giving way when preſſed with the finger, by ſhortneſs of breath, &amp;c. and it is dangerous becauſe of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the noble parts.</p>

Or ſo as that <hi>the Ends of the Bones are out of their places.</hi> Then the fleſh above the broken Rib is blown and heaved up: and if the place be preſſed with the hand, a noiſe is heard of the departing Air. Inflamation, Feavers, Impoſtumes, do for the moſt part follow. Or the <hi>whole Ribs are not broken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="8">VIII. Of the <hi>Patella</hi> or <hi>Whirl-bone</hi> of the Knee, which is known, by inability to go, and an hollowneſs which is perceived in the place of the fracture. It <hi>happens</hi> either <hi>long waies;</hi> and then the bones are eaſily joyned together again. Or athwart or ſlanting. Then no art can ſo help it, as to hinder the Patient from halting.</p>

                  <p>Its SIGNS are wearyneſs which comes of it ſelf, without any exerciſe of the Body. Heavineſs about the temples and forehead. A certain Itch of the Noſtrils, a gentle Heat. Moiſtneſs of the skin, with diſtention of the Members. A pulſe great, ful, frequent, quick. Difficulty in fetching breath. Urine thicker and more red than ordinary.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is, the working and boyling of thin blood which ariſe from the hinderance of Tranſpiration, in a plethorick body, which ſends forth many hot Vapours.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Putrid Feaver in general, is a Feaver, which ariſes from hot Vapors, raiſed out of the Putrefaction of humors, which affect the heart; with a praeternatural heat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SIGNS thereof, are: <hi>Invation</hi> with ſhivering, and ſhaking, no antecedent Cauſe having preceded; No, nor no procatarctick, unleſs the body be ſo diſpoſed that a ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affects it. <hi>Acceſſions</hi> and Paroxyſmes or

               <p>The <hi>Cauſes immediate</hi> are, putred vapors, ſharp, biting, plentiful, ſo as they cannot be diſcuſſed. The <hi>Mediate</hi> is the putrefaction of humors, whoſe cauſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>Synochus putrida, <hi>is a feaver ariſing from blood putrified in the vena cava without any periodical Remiſſion and Intention, afflicting alike from the begining to the End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo termed <hi>Pur,</hi> Fire; becauſe of its very great Heat. <hi>Aſſodes</hi> becauſe it makes the Patient very unreſtible. <hi>Taraxodes</hi> becauſe it vexes the Sick with imaginary Apparitions. And <hi>Pericaes Puretos,</hi> the burning fever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Exceſs of burning Heat.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pathognomonick</hi> or <hi>peculiar Signs</hi> are, <hi>extream thirſt</hi> and burning <hi>Heat,</hi> howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the thirſt is allaied by coughing, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es an Afflux of humors. To theſe ſignes are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, great <hi>tumblings and toſſings of the Body,</hi> by reaſon of great heat, and the acrimony of thin vapours, which in every part vex the body. The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin</hi> is little in quantity, through plenty of ſweat and heat, which conſume the ſame: ſomtimes tis crude and troubled, which by the ſettling of the adventitious parts, and evaporation of the turbulent ſpirits, doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwartd waxe cleare; ſomtimes tis thin, very cholorick and flame-colored. The <hi>ſtooles,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the dung be ſcorched and hardened by the feavers Heat, are liquid and ſaffron-colored, choler being ſhed into the belly and making the dung thin. The <hi>pulſe</hi> is quick, frequent and unequal. ſwifter in the Contraction, becauſe the Arteries by ſuddain compreſſion, indeavour to expel thoſe ſooty vapours, which greiviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflict the heart. <hi>Breathing</hi> is labourſome, and expiration is quicker than drawing-in of the air, by reaſon of the extraordinary neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſending forth the fiery exhalations. The <hi>Mouth</hi> is bitter, becauſe choler is ſoakt into the inner Coat of the ſtomach, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to it and the mouth. The <hi>Tongue</hi> is dry, and furr'd, and black, becauſe the burning heat conſumes the moiſture of the tongue, and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges its ſooty vapours therein. <hi>Raving,</hi> by reaſon of the mounting of choler into the head; which if it follow trembling, tis a ſigne that the cholerick humor is transferred out of the veins into the Nerves, out of the nerves into the Brain. <hi>Sleep</hi> is ſomtimes profound, eſpecially when the fever is not exquiſite, but baſtard; becauſe thick vapours carried into the Brain, do ſtop the paſſages thereof.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is <hi>Blood</hi> putrifying, through a peculiar propriety of the liver, occaſioned by meates of an over heating faculty: or from crude, cooling meats, apt to be corrupted &amp;c. Which blood is either <hi>Cholerick,</hi> and then the ſymptomes ſpecified in the definition are more vehement, and the feaver is termed <hi>Cauſus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitus,</hi> an exquiſit burning feaver: or <hi>Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> &amp; then the fymptoms are milder &amp; the fever is termed <hi>nothus</hi> a baſtard burning feaver.</p>
                     <p>The CURE requires that we regard the Feaver, Its cauſe and the patients ſtrength. The feaver is terminated by ſundry excreſſions, eſpecially when the patient happens to <hi>ſhake</hi> upon a critical day, the ſignes of Coction appearing: and that not by reaſon of the ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but becauſe of the Excretion, whoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is the ſhaking fit.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Generally conſidered, it is a Feaver ariſing from Excrementitious Humors, putrefying in thoſe Veins, which are of a middle ſize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the greateſt and the ſmalleſt, Capillary or Third Veins; abating at certain Periods of time, without any Total Intermiſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Signs</hi> are, that it <hi>remits</hi> of its Violence, and then grows again Exorbitant, at certain Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, but <hi>never intermits</hi> ſo as to leave the Patient free from Feaveriſh diſtemper more or leſs.

It is <hi>exaſperated</hi> at certain ſet Periods of time, both by the arrival of Morbifick matter to the Heart, by uneven quantities (becauſe of diſtance of place) if it do not exactly keep its times: and alſo by communication of new matter from the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſubſervient to the ſecond Digeſtion, if it hold punctually its times.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are <hi>Excrementitious Humors</hi> which are bred in the Spleen and Liver, either by their fault, or the fault of the <hi>Chylus;</hi> yet they may be bred in the Meſeraick Veins, and brought to the Liver.

                        <p>
                           <hi>A continual quotidian, is a Feaver raiſed by the Phlegmatick Humor putrifying in the Branches of</hi> Vena Cava, <hi>which is exaſperated every day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its SIGN is a daily Exaſperation, which happens towards the Evening, becauſe of the natural motion of flegm about that time; with heat, which is at firſt feeling mild, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more vehement, by reaſon of the ſlow and uneven kindling thereof, cauſed by the variety of the parts of Flegm. With a light coldneſs of the extream parts of the Body, which nevertheleſs, is not found in al theſe Feavers.</p>
                        <p>The CAUSE is, the Humor of Flegm putrifying, which is proper to old Men becauſe of their coldneſs, to Children through their greedy eating. It Cauſes ſo pertinacious and ſtubborne a Feaver, that it laſts, ſomtimes, three ſcore daies, its beginning reaching to the twentieth day; it vehemently weakens the Stomach; whence ariſes a <hi>Cachexy</hi> and <hi>Dropſie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The CURE ought to be thus mannaged
<list>
                              <item>1. The firſt paſſages muſt be evacuated with Clyſters, or Lenitive Medicaments, in which caſe <hi>Honey of Roſes</hi> is effectual; or the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach muſt be purged with Vomit.</item>

                        <p n="2">II. Another is termed <hi>Epiala,</hi> in which in the ſmalleſt particles of the body (underſtand to the ſenſe) both heat and cold are felt at one and the ſame time.

                     <p>Their <hi>Differences</hi> are ſundry.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One ſort is <hi>That which follows the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of ſome inward parteſpecially, and which is neare the heart, or has a conſent and ſympathy therewith,</hi> the Vapors which ariſe out of the blood ſhed into the part inflamed, and putrifying there, being communicated to the heart, and heating the ſame. It is <hi>as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-fold,</hi> as the Inflamation is. The <hi>Cure</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Inflamation.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another ſort there is, termed <hi>Lipyrias,</hi> in which during the whole courſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the inner parts are as it were burning up with Heat, and the outer parts meane while cold. It <hi>ariſes</hi> from a vehement inflamation or Eryſipelas of ſome internal part, eſpecially the Stomach, the blood and ſpirits having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the part inflamed. Either the <hi>Cure</hi> is not to be undertaken; or if it be undertaken, reſiſtance muſt be made inwardly againſt the putrefaction and extream heat; <hi>external,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the parts have been rubbed, heaters, and openers of the pores muſt be applied. In which caſe Oyl of Dill, and Oyl of Orice Root, with oyl of Vitriol, and ſtrong ſpirit of Juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are good.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is ſlow, which is <hi>hereby knowen,</hi> in that it afflicts with a gentle heat, with which appear the notes of putrefaction, in in the Urine and Pulſe. It is not burthenſome to the Patient by any grevious ſymtome. The Patient can hardly ſtir on his Legs for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The bodie pines away by little and little. 'Tis protracted beyond the fortieth day. 'Tis exaſperated by the uſe of Purgers. It keeps no order. It <hi>ariſes</hi> from putrefaction of matter ſhed forth of the Veſſels into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſome bowel, or at leaſt faſt fixed in the Capillary Veins, which are diſperſed through the ſubſtance of the bowels, and by its putrefaction corrupting the ſaid ſubſtance. From whence Vapors cannot be carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heart, in ſuch great plenty, as in other Feavers. Tis <hi>Cured</hi> by aperitives,

                     <p n="4">IV.

For there remains a defilement in that part which is the ſeat of the putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a weakneſs alſo in the ſaid part. Wherupon the affluent Humor though it be good, is defiled by the impurity of the part, as it were with Leven, and through the weakneſs of the parts it is corrupted.

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Conjunction</hi> is various. For <hi>ſomtime</hi> a nonputrid is joyned with a Putrid: ſomtimes a <hi>putrid</hi> with a Putrid; and that, either with a continual or an intermittent; with an intermittent; or contrary wiſe.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are the ſame with the Signs of ſimple Feavers, eſpecially the return of cold, ſhivering and ſhaking after ſome reſpite.

               <p>AN Hectick, is a Feaver ariſing from heat, in ſuch ſort Occupying the parts of the Body, that though it be fomented by no cauſe, yet it continues.</p>
               <p>Its SIGNS are theſe; <hi>Heat,</hi> which cauſes no pain, becauſe the ſolid parts are already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. 'Tis weak at firſt; becauſe of paucity of Vapors; biting afterward, becauſe of the ſolidity of the Parts. In the Arteries greater becauſe of their correſpondence with the heart. An hour or two after meals, Tis augmented, becauſe of the Humectation of the dry and ſolid parts; freely, without compreſſion, without Horror and Rigor, with a great and ſwift pulſe; the Meat being diſtributed it ceaſes. It alſo dries up al the radical moiſture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the ſecondary Humors, and melts al the fat in the Body.</p>
               <p>Its CAUSE is, either other <hi>Feavers</hi> either burning or long-laſting; or Diſeaſes of the internal Bowels, as cheifly of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or <hi>External Evident Cauſes,</hi> very vehement, which conſume much of the ſubſtance in the ſolid Members, raiſe up very great and long heat, yet introduce it not into the ſolid parts before they Have introduced it into the ſpirits in the firſt place.</p>

               <p>An Hectick is divided two manner of waies.</p>
               <p n="1">I. One ſort is <hi>without a Conſumption,</hi> when the dewy moiſture of the parts is not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. When it <hi>begins;</hi> tis hardly known, unleſs a man may gather it from the bodies lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, its Chollerick Complexion, and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Breſt. In the <hi>Progreſs</hi> and Ephemera being preſent, the Heat laſts beyond a day with encreaſe; about the third day, the heat is encreaſed after meat.</p>
               <p>Another is <hi>with a Conſumption,</hi> and is two-fold <hi>the one cald Maraſmodes, when the dewy moiſture is conſumed, and the fleſhy ſubſtance begins to be preid upon. Then</hi> the body grows leane, the Temples fal, the palms of the Hands and ſoles of the Feet, are hot; and thoſe other accidents follow, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The ſtooles have a greaſie ſubſtance among them. It is alſo voided by Urine, not much at once as in perſons of good conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor with pain of the Kidneis, as in ſolution of the fatneſs of the Kidneys; but ſlowly, and a little at a time. Sediment like bran is ſeen in the Urine, without any Diſeaſe in the bladder, ſwelling of the Thighs, and a looſeneſs, which threatens Death. <hi>Another</hi> is when <hi>the Fibrous and Membranous ſubſtance, is violated by the Feaveriſh heat.</hi> Hence follows the <hi>Maraſmos,</hi> which happens ſomtimes to Young and Old Preternaturally: ſomtimes through defect of Aliment, and extinction of the natural heat, either in regard of Age, or of ſome Scirrhous Tumor. See thereof, <hi>Joel</hi> in the foreſaid Tome.</p>
               <p n="2">II. One ſort is <hi>ſimple</hi> to which what has been before ſaid in general may be applied.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56003:93"/>Another is <hi>Complicated,</hi> and that either with a <hi>Putrid intermittent,</hi> and then the greateſt part of the Heat remains in fiery, and the leaſt is come into Act. The fit being finiſhed, the places of the Arteries grow hot, the other parts are temperate. The Pulſe looſes not its fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and ſwiftneſs, and the Patients meat does not eucreaſe ſtrength. Or with a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Putrid,</hi> and then tis hardly known. The dry heat remains after the end of the declination, or of the whole Feaver. The Body is more extenuated. The Urine is fatty and Oyly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Malignant Feavers generally conſidered, are Feavers ariſing from ſome hidden cauſe partaking of a Venemous kind of Quality, cauſing more grevious Symptomes than ordinary, and yet not killing many, or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their SIGNS are, great <hi>weakneſs</hi> from the begining, without any manifeſt Cauſe, more than the Feaver and Feaveriſh heat could probably produce. <hi>Pulſe</hi> frequent, Smal, Weak: or if the Pulſe being natural, ſeem to deceive, tis known by the preſence of other Symptomes. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rins</hi> are ſome times, in the firſt daies, like thoſe of heathly perſons: ſomtimes thick, colored, troubled, having a thick red and troubled ſediment. The Heat milder than ſutes with the Nature of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and Symptomes. A Maſs of Symptomes, animal, Vital and natural. Swellings or ſpots break forth &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE are, either the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> of <hi>Humors,</hi> or <hi>Contagion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The CURE is <hi>Hard,</hi> if greater and more conſtant Symptomes appear. Dropping of blood at the beginning ſignifies the working of the Humors, their bad Quality and the Patients weakneſs. Tis performed bp Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoardicks and other things of which in the Differences.</p>
                  <p>The Differences of Malignant Feavers are taken from the Cauſes,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Some are from the <hi>Bad Diſpoſitions of Humors</hi> and <hi>their Plenty</hi> whether in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, about the Midrif, or in the firſt waies. They are <hi>known</hi> by Stomach-ſickneſs, Pain, Heat, Bitterneſs of the Mouth, anxiety and other tokens. <hi>They ariſe</hi> either from corrupt meats, or from ſome other cauſe. <hi>Are Cured.</hi>

                        <item>1. By <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> which ought to be Practiſed after the Evacuation of the firſt waies by Lenitive Medicaments, leaſt a greater Ebullition and working of the Humors becauſed, and that before the fourth day.</item>
                        <item>2. By giving of <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> which neither augment the Feaver, nor are very ſtrong, that either the Body may be diſpoſed to ſweat, or at leaſt the Malignity may be expelled.</item>
                        <item>3. By <hi>alteration</hi> and preparation, with ſuch things as ſtop the Commotion of the blood and refiſt the malignity thereof. The Juyce of <hi>Citrons, Pomegranates,</hi> and the Root of <hi>Scorzonera</hi> are commended &amp;c.</item>
                     </list> Yea and alſo the ſpirit of Vitriol with other Syrups, unleſs the Patients be aged and lean: and unleſs their Lungs be otherwiſe diſeaſed than through flegm ſtopping the Veſſels. IIII. By <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> which ought to be effected by gentle Medicaments and ſcarce before the fourteenth day. V. By <hi>giving</hi> cooling diureticks, if the matter of the Diſeaſe go that way. VI. By application of <hi>Topicks</hi> to the Pulſes and the heart al the time of the Diſeaſe. VII. By mitigation or taking away ſuch <hi>Symptomes as ſhal happen.</hi> VIII. By <hi>Diet,</hi> in which we muſt abſtain from wine, unleſs faintings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. A Decoction of Harts-horn with ſuch a Quantity of ſpirit of Vitriol, as may cauſe a grateful acidity; to which a little Julep of Roſes or Viollets may be added; muſt be given.

                        <hi>Febris pefechialis, or the spotted feaver, is a malignant Feaver, in which certain ſpots like flea bitings of ſundry colors, but cheifly red, appear upon the skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpots are called <hi>puncticulae, petechiae, peticulae.</hi> Whence the feavers are termed alſo puncticulares, periculares, and <hi>lenticulares.</hi>

They appeare in the back, Armes, Thighes, Breſt; viz. places through which the moſt notable Arteries and veins doe paſſe. Seldom in the face becauſe the cold air repels the matter from thence. There appears no prick in the middle of them, and ſo they are diſtinguiſhed from flea-bitings.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, the thinner part of the putrid humor, which makes that they ſoone vaniſh.

               <p>Its SIGNS are, Symptomes Fewer and milder than are uſual in the Plague: of which we ſhal treat in the next Chapter, fee more in the Differences.</p>
               <p>The CAUSES are the ſame with thoſe of the Plague, and differ only in reſpect of the Contagion, Vehemence and Magnitude.</p>

                     <item>III. By <hi>Purgation</hi> of <hi>the firſt Paſſages,</hi> eſpecially by Clyſters, eſpecially if bad Humors abounding be the Cauſe; but Antidotes muſt be given afterwards.</item>

                  <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> of this diſtemper is the brain, but more eſpecially according unto the ſuperior parts thereof. The <hi>Signs</hi> hereof are, a ſudden Conſternation of the ſick, inſomuch that they become, as it were, altogether dumb, ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and like wiſe altogether deprived of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only they open their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is either ſome violent blow, or dangerous fal, or the extream and over-long noiſe of Guns and Thunder-Claps; which either only diſturb the ſpirits for the preſent, or elſe they cauſe a fracture of the skul.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe Inflamation of the brain is a ſwelling thereof proceeding from blood poured forth out of the Veſſels into the void ſpaces of that part, and there putrefying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The SIGNS are, an acute and continual Feaver, which from third day to third day is exaſperated; a perpetual doting, which began ſenſibly, or gradually, and by little and little, a red kind of color and deformity of the Face and Eyes, the Membranes being dryed up by the burning heat, Salt and ſharp tears, the Excrementitious moiſture flowing downward (as it were) of its owns accord by reaſon of the weakneſs of the part, a ſwift and quick Pulſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is, blood falling out the Veſſels, and there putrefying, the tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there of being intercepted. It is <hi>Poured</hi> or emptyed forth, either by reaſon of its ſtore and over great abundance: or elſe by reaſon of its thinneſs and acrimony; thoſe things likewiſe helping forward and furthering the ſame, which either carry the blood to the Head, or elſe at leaſtwiſe violently move and ſtir the ſame; and ſuch are, the heat of the Air, pain, ſtriking, a wound, wrath, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is but very little, or rather <hi>No</hi> hope at al of the <hi>Cure</hi> hereof, if a Convulſion follow upon it; if the Urin be white and extraordinary clear, becauſe then the choler is forcibly drawn up into the Head; if a doting being at the firſt preſent, there follow thereupon gnaſhing and grating together of the Teeth by reaſon of the Convulſion of the Muſcles in the temples, and Jaws; if it tend to a ſuppuration in regard that the <hi>Pus</hi> or filthy Corrupt matter cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be evacuated within or betwixt the Skul and the Membrane. There may be ſome hopes, if on the critical day ſtore of blood flow forth at the Noſtrils; if there be much (and that hot) ſweat from the Head, and if after the heighth of the diſeaſe there be an Evacuation of abundance of yellow choler by the belly. There is but ſmal hope of a Cure, if many of the Functions be hurt and empaired; if there be a trembling of the Tongue; if a kind of cold ſtiffneſs infeſt and invade the Patient, after he hath voided downwards white Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if there appear to fal from the Noſtrils a black drop, and that ſuch is ſincere or bright, in regard that it proceeds from a very vehement aduſtion; and laſtly if they ſcrape together Straws, &amp;c.

                  <p n="1">I. The firſt <hi>ſpecies</hi> in the diviſion is that which <hi>Precedes</hi> a <hi>Feaver,</hi> in which we are allowed to purge while the feaver is abſent; &amp; more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if there be preſent an extraordinary cacochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cupping-glaſſes are to be impoſed &amp; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the very top of the crown, with ſcarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation following therupon.

                  <p n="2">II. Another ſort thereof ariſeth <hi>rather</hi> from <hi>blood</hi> than <hi>Cholor;</hi> in which a greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and portion of the blood is to draw forth by opening of a Vein: but then there is likewiſe another, which proceedeth from <hi>Choler rather

                  <p n="3">III. Another is an Inflamation of the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Brian;</hi> unto which the ſigns before alleadged do very fitly agree. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other there is of the ſubſtance of the Brain it ſelf, in which there is at the firſt a pain ſeizing the Head, which by the hinder part thereof pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates even unto the very nook of the Neck.

                  <p>There is in this diſtemper no need at al of SIGNS; for the diſeaſe may be ſufficiently known by the very ſight of the party. It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſeaſe of Infants than of perſons of years and ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is a Humor that is wateriſh, wheyie, and ſomtime dreggy, yea moreover alſo bloody.</p>
                  <p>The CURE is exceeding <hi>doubtful;</hi> as wel becauſe the diſtemper is in a Noble part; as likewiſe becauſe the ſubject part is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: as alſo in regard that an Apoplexy or a Lethargy do eaſily ſoon ſeize upon the party.

                        <hi>The wound or fracture of the skull, is a continual ſolution in the ſame, cauſed by ſome external violence and force, and yet ſuch as reacheth not, neither attaineth unto the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the brain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are taken <hi>as wel</hi> from the concourſe of the ſymptoms that follow it, (as for inſtance, a vomiting of Choller, a flux of blood by the noſtrils and ears, a fal, a noiſe of a broken bone, &amp;c.) as from the nature and condition of the blow, where regard is to be had unto the ſtriker, or that which giveth the blow, unto the condition of the head receiveing the blowor ſtroke, and the diſpoſition of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as alſo it is diſcovered by the chyrurgions probe (which ought to be neither too ſharp, nor over thick) by ink, and by ſhaving thereof, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSES are evident, diſſolving and looſening continuity in the <hi>Cranium</hi> or skul.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is not to be hoped for, (for <hi>Cure</hi> there is <hi>none</hi>) if after the ſeventh day a caver come to appear; becauſe it is a certain ſigne and token of putrefaction and rottenneſs in the brain; or if the wound become wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, dry, purulent, and black.</p>
                     <p>The cure is very <hi>doubtful,</hi> if inſtantly the patients ſtrength and ſpirits fail him; (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Party be old, becauſe then his heat is by much, weaker, and the blood ſerous or wheyiſh) if the head be prone and ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſtillations, and the tumors called <hi>Eriſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> if the ſymptoms, that ſoon began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and ſhew themſelves, on the fourth or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, ſtil continue and rather increaſe than otherwiſe. The Cure is a work of <hi>great pains</hi> and difficulty, if it be to be attempted in the ſummer time in regard of a fear we are to have of an inflamation iminent and very nigh at hand; if it be in a moiſt Climate or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe the brain is very eaſily offended by cold and moiſt things; if it happen at the ful of the moon, by reaſon of the abundance of humors more at that time than other; if the wound be very nigh unto the brain; if it be in the fore part of the head, and the middle of the brain, becauſe that the brain being a neer neighbor hereunto is more arcuated or arched, and there is not fit paſſage left for the efflux of the filth and corruption; if it chance to be in the Temples, becauſe the muſcles of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples do abound with arteries, veins, and ſinues, or nerves, and ſo by this means the motion of the lower Jaw is much prejudiced and hurt, if it be in the ſutures, both becauſe that there the skul is weak, and becauſe likewiſe that there the <hi>dura mater</hi> is knit unto the fibres; and laſtly, if it happen with a contuſion, in regard that the ſayd contuſion cauſeth very many, and thoſe likewiſe hidden miſcheifs and Evils. Touching the <hi>ordinance</hi> and inſtitution of the <hi>cure,</hi> (if at leaſt, there be any hope thereof) theſe things are to be obſerved,

                           <item>I. That the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to be <hi>evacuated</hi> or emptyed; becauſe that in Plethorick and ful bodies even thoſe wounds that are in themſelves but ſlight and very inconſiderable do yet by reaſon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant humidity attract and draw together many dangerous ſymptomes; inſomuch that unto the milder and gentler ſort of medicaments ſtronger may and ought to be added, and cheifly ſuch as purge choller and the thin wheyiſh part of the blood; we ought likewiſe to inſtiture and appoint veneſection or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a veine; and clyſters are alſo to be apli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</item>

If the skin be wounded, and yet the orifice not wide enough, it is then to be more and wider opened, until that the whole fiſſure or cleft appear manifeſtly unto the view of him that ſearcheth it. But then indeed a Section or opening of the <hi>Pericranium</hi> ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, when there is any ſuſpition that the Skul is hurt. That kind of Section that is (in regard of its tranſverſe lines) made like unto the figure and faſhion of a Croſs, is the moſt fit and proper in this caſe.</item>
                           <item>IV. The Muſcles of the Temples, (by reaſon of their Nervoſity or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newineſs) ought very carefully to be avoyded in the aforeſaid Section; and ſo likewiſe are the ſutures, by reaſon of the tranſverſe paſſage of the Fibres.</item>
                           <item>V. In the wound of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, we muſt take heed that the Section be not made tranſverſe: for if the Muſcle that lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up the Eye-lid ſhould by this means be cut, the Eye-Lid then Unavoydably falleth down.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are taken from this, to wit, that the ſick party ſleepeth for the moſt part with his lower Jaw-bone hanging down, and with his Mouth gaping and wide open; when he is rouzed and ſtird up he openeth his Eyes, and anſwereth, but immediatly again falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.

                     <p>The CAUSE is, whatſoever impedes or hinders and prohibites the influx of the Animal ſpirits unto the Organs of the ſenſes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Renders thoſe ſpirits more unapt unto the Animal actions and operations.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken from the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is from <hi>Cauſes</hi> that are <hi>Evident,</hi> exagitating and exaſperating the ſpirits; and ſuch are a turning round of the whol body a long while together, looking much and ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon things while they are moved circularly, and a proſpect or looking downward to the earth from a place of an extraordinary height. For ſo by this means the ſpirits (by the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and looking upon any thing unto which it is not accuſtomed, or that is dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible) are diffuſed and drawn back. It is <hi>known</hi> by the relation of the ſick party. It is cured by reſt and ſleep. If it yet be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ceaſed, then we are to conclude the Cure by frictions. If it be from <hi>Hunger</hi> and faſting, a piece of bread dipt in the Juyce of <hi>Pomegranates,</hi> or in ſharp ſowr wine, is firſt of al to be adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is from the narrowneſs or <hi>Streightneſs of the Paſſage of the Brain,</hi> through which indeed the Animal ſpirits are moved; but when they are thus impeded and hindered, they then retreat back again. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> either from a partial obſtruction, which if it be cauſed by groſs and thick Vapors, it is ſoon diſſolved; if it hath its riſe from ſerous and Phlegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; it is then of a long continuance, and there is withal preſent a ſenſe of fluctuation. In the Cure there ought to be a reſpect had unto the Nature of the Cauſe. Or <hi>elſe</hi> it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the compreſſion of the brain, and the fracture of the skul; of which ſee further in their own propper places: Or <hi>elſe,</hi> it is from the <hi>Coaleſcence</hi> or knitting together of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, from their firſt riſe, and their entering into the ſcalp or Skul, by that general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſſage through the brain, touching which there is hardly any thing to be certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, while the Patient liveth.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is from a Vapor ful of windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, generated and bred in the brain, which by an inordinate motion being poured forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veins and Arteries, doth ſo trouble and diſturb the Animal ſpirits by driving to and fro, that they thus become to be circularly moved and turned round, and then they exhibite and repreſent unto the common ſenſe or Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie this falſ and feigned ſpecies and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things, otherwiſe than indeed they really are. It is <hi>known</hi> by that vehement pain, and dul heavineſs of the head, a long continued tinging and hiſſing Noiſe in the Ears, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of hurt and detriment of the external ſenſes. This Evil or Malady is very frequent, and ſuch as ſurpriſeth a man upon a very ſmal and light occaſion; and yet it laſteth, and (as we uſe to ſay) ſticketh long by him. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from cauſes that generate and breed winds and windineſs, and more eſpecially if the wonted Evacuation be ſuppreſſed. It is <hi>Cured, either</hi> in the Paroxyſm, (of which we have before ſpoken) <hi>or,</hi> out of the Paroxyim;

                        </list> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſpecifical and Appropriate Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thoſe that deſerve the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, are, the <hi>dung</hi> of the <hi>Peacock</hi> (one dram thereof by weight) macerated in Wine, ſtrained, and ſo drunk up; the extract of <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> the Roots of <hi>Doronicum</hi> (an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent drug brought out of <hi>Mauritania</hi>) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Bears Ear,</hi> the fat of <hi>Does,</hi> and land <hi>Snakes,</hi> by annoynting the Temples therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the pouder of <hi>Silk-worms dryed</hi> and ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Crown of the Head. Very effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual likewiſe for this purpoſe, are, the ſpirits of <hi>Roſemary,</hi> the Chymical Oyl of <hi>Yellow Amber, Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Treacle,</hi> the pouder of the <hi>Right mineral Cinnabar,</hi> half an ounce thereof: <hi>Margarites prepared,</hi> and <hi>red Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als prepared, of each two ſcruples; Saffron one ſcruple;</hi> and then add to the aforeſaid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56003:105"/>ingredients the <hi>leaves of Gold, in number ten,</hi> and ſo let it be adminiſtred (the doſe is one ſcruple) in the water of lillies of the Valley; and laſtly, the electuary of <hi>Saxony.</hi> It is <hi>divided</hi> into that which is from extream <hi>hot blood;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> there is preſent a redneſs of the Face, and a beating of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In the <hi>Cure,</hi> eſpecial regard is to be had unto the opening of a Vein, and that cheifly and primarily, of the Baſilike, if a Plethory accompany the diſtemper; and then preſently after, of the Cephalick or head vein, if the peccant matter abound moſt, or only in the head. It is not to be drawn forth al at once, but by many Eſſaies, at ſeveral times, by intervals. We ought not to be over raſh in attemping the cutting or opening of an Artery: and into that, <hi>that is from a pituitous</hi> or Flegmy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. <hi>Then,</hi> the place where we have treated of the Flegmatick diſtemper is to be conſulted. An Evacuation (after that a Clyſter hath firſt of al been adminiſtred) may very conveniently and ſucceſsfully be expedited by the extract of the <hi>Pils</hi> called <hi>Cochiae,</hi> from half a ſcruple to a ſcruple; by a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and a Balſam: See further hereof in <hi>Agricola,</hi> in his firſt Book, 38.

                     <p n="4">IV. Another there is from an extream <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Vapor,</hi> elevated from other parts. It is <hi>known</hi> by this, that there went before it no hurt or annoyance of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It ariſeth either from the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> either pirrocholick or ful of bitter choler, or Pituitous and Flegmatick, or elſe by reaſon of its imbecillity corrupting al the food that comes within it: and then the <hi>Cure</hi> muſt cheifly reſpect, and be directed unto the ſtomach. And here take place (as moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit and proper) a <hi>grain</hi> or two of <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> taken after meals, the confection of <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> of <hi>Coriander,</hi> Sugar of <hi>Prunella, Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Roſatum</hi> or Sugar of Roſes, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of the Conſerve of old red Roſes, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydonium</hi> ſimplex, that is an electuary of the conſerve of Quinces, the ſpirit of vitriol, and the Syrup of mints.

                     <p>The CURE reſpects the ſeveral Cauſes, and may be taken and underſtood, by what

                        <hi>A Phrenſie is a perpetual and Continual deliry or dotage, ariſing from the Inflamation of the Membranes of the brain, and afflicting the Patient with a continued Feaver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, a perpetual doting, a continual Feaver, inceſſant watchings, and ſhort and frequent drawing of the breathe.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is an inflamation of the Membranes of the Brain; of the which we have already above treated in this very Book.</p>
                     <p>The CURE ought to be ordained accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Diſeaſe, the Nature of the wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and the ſuppreſſion of the Urine. <hi>In this diſtemper, Veneſection</hi> or blood-letting is one eſpecial, if not the only Remedy. But then a plentiful meaſure, or, as we ſay, good ſtore of blood is ſomtimes to be drawn forth at the Noſtrils, by putting up a Feather made into the faſhion of a Star, even unto the very Root of them, and forcibly turned about therein. But touching what we are now upon, more may be ſeen in what hath been already delivered concerning the Inflamation of the brain. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we forget, (by reaſon of <hi>thoſe</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid watchings) together with repellers, to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Hypnoticks, that cauſe reſt; or elſe they ought to be adminiſtred ſeverally and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, as we ſee good. Three grains of <hi>Opiat Laudanum</hi> cautelouſly adminiſtred in a convenient liquor, (leaſt the Phrenſie ſhould by any means degenerate into that Diſeaſe we cal <hi>Veternus,</hi> that is, the Lethargy, or drouſie diſtemper) are very much commended. <hi>This</hi> ſaid mutation or change is wont to happen, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its own accord, or elſe becauſe the ſick perſons neglect, &amp; cannot endure to reply unto thoſe that ſpeak unto them; and it is ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away by the uſe of Emollient Fomentations. In this greif, there have their uſe, that which we term <hi>Luna Potabilis Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni,</hi> ſix drops thereof; and that they cal <hi>Pharmocum Phantaſticum,</hi> of Bartoletus, (the doſe whereof is from one dram to two drams) &amp; laſtly, the ſpirit of <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> or the ſealed earth brought from the Iſle <hi>Lemnos.</hi>

                     <head>Article, IV. <hi>Of Melancholly.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Melancholy is a dotage ariſing from a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy phantaſme, with the which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is affected, and deteyned therunder, he becomes wholly and only addicted to thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, being as it were altogether ingulphed therein, without either fury or Feaver, but yet without penſiveneſs and fearfulneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, a deep ſadneſs and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs without any apparent cauſe, and then likewiſe another ſign is Taciturnity, and a long continued ſilence, or elſe incongruous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and talk at random, and this more eſpecially of ſome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> thing more than other.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is a Melancholy Phantaſm that proceedeth from an error, vice, and diſtemper of the Animal ſpirits, the which (when as they ought to be clear, thin, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and moveable) are hereby rendered and made obſcure and miſty, opacious, thick and dark, as alſo fixed and almoſt wholly immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable. And hence it cometh to paſs, that al kind of objects are imprinted upon their ſeveral ſpecies, according to the condition and quality of the vitiated and depraved diſpoſition of the ſpirits. And they acquire and gain this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from a <hi>default in the Brain,</hi> declining from its genuine whitneſs, and generating ſuch like ſpirits as theſe: or elſe they have their original from ſome default in <hi>the matter out of which they are made</hi> and bred, to wit, the blood and the Vital ſpirit: or elſe laſtly, they got this vitious diſpoſition from ſome <hi>impure</hi> and melancholy <hi>Matter,</hi> (which is mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the blood and ſpirits) whether it be an Humor, or a vapor, or both.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>facil</hi> and Eaſie, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper be recent, and but now beginning; for ſo it is cured by diet alone, together with the humectation of the whol body, and ſomtimes of the head in particular; as likewiſe if the Body receive any augmentation and growth from the aforeſaid food; if only the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination be no more than hurt; and then again, if it be with ſome kind of laughter accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it. But Cure there is <hi>none,</hi> if the affect be hereditary. See above further hereof (touching the <hi>Progreſs</hi> to be made in attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting the Cure) in the Chapter of the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly diſtemper of the brain; and below, in the differences. Notwithſtanding, obſerve here.

                        </list> The Remedies that in this caſe are commended, are, <hi>Confection</hi> of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> the <hi>Tincture</hi> and <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Lazulus, Elixir proprietutis,</hi> the <hi>bezoar ſtone, Cachunde,</hi> an Indian Medicament; the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription whereof ſee <hi>in Lacutus</hi> his Phyſical Hiſtory, 1. Book, Page, 310.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>divided</hi> into ſome certain ſpecies.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is that of the <hi>brain,</hi> when the brain (in the Nature and quality of its ſubſtance) departeth from its natural cleerneſs and purity. It is <hi>known by this,</hi> that the doting is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and vehement; that there are preſent ſigns of Melancholy abounding in the head; that the blood, if it be let out, is not thick, nor black. It <hi>ariſeth Externally,</hi> from a ſtrong Phanſie or imagination, from fear &amp; other ſuch like ſad and grievous affections of the mind. It ariſeth <hi>Internally,</hi> from a Melancholick Humor hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the head; and this, either by reaſon of ſome acquired cold diſtemper of the brain; or elſe in regard of its Melancholly conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which may ſoon be known from the affects) or otherwiſe, laſtly, by reaſon of ſome cold and dry matter left behind in the brain, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome hot diſtempers there, the heat now abating, and the thinner part of the matter being now reſolved, and gone. It is <hi>Cured,</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. By the <hi>Alteration and Preparation</hi> of the peccant matter by <hi>Fumary,</hi> the water or ſyrup of ſweet ſmelling Apples, and Tartar of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</item>
                           <item>2. By the <hi>Evacuation</hi> thereof with the <hi>Extract</hi> of <hi>Hellebor</hi> (the inferior waies and paſſages being firſt opened) by Errhines, and Sternutatories.</item>
                           <item>3. By Procuring reſt and ſleep in the uſe of Hypnoticks.</item>
                           <item>4. by Corroberating and ſtrengthening the Head, by the Tincture of the <hi>Chryſolite,</hi> and other appropriate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is that of the <hi>whole</hi> Body, when a Melancholy blood aboundeth throughout the whol body, and is from thence tranſmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brain. It is <hi>known</hi> by this, that the deliry or dotage is indeed continual; but yet ſo, that it is with ſome certain exaſperations, exacerbations, and remiſſions; and likewiſe, in that there are preſent ſigns of Melancholy abounding in the body, and that there went before the Cauſes thereof. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from its own proper Cauſes, of which we ſhal ſpeak further in the Differences. It is <hi>Cured,</hi> by the frequent repetition of <hi>Veneſection</hi> or blood-letting. But becauſe there are but very few ſpirits in Melaucholly perſons; it muſt <hi>not be of too much blood at once;</hi> it may be either in the left Arm, or in the Ankle, or elſe the thigh Veins (if large) may be opened by Leeches.
<list>
                           <item>2. By a <hi>Preparation of the Humor,</hi> by the Syrup of <hi>Odoriferous Apples, Fumary</hi> with the cream of Tartar, &amp; Tartur vitriolate, by the fection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> the Whey of <hi>Milk,</hi> with the Juyce of Cichory and Fumary.</item>
                           <item>3. By a <hi>gentle Evacuation thereof,</hi> often Reiterated, and corrected by ſuch things as corroborate the ſpirits and the principal parts; and likewiſe by thoſe things that Humectate, moiſten, and mollifie: but then the Evacuation may, and ought to be ſtronger, if ſo be the blood be over thick, and unleſs the body be already extreamly and over much waſted. This Evacuation muſt be ſeconded and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Moyſtening Baths, unto the which Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients are to be added.</item>
                           <item>4. By drinking of <hi>tart,</hi> ſharp, and ſomwhat ſowr potions, and alſo by the uſe of hot <hi>baths.</hi>

                           <item>5. By the <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> both by internals and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, among which <hi>Embrochations</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indeed cheifly commended.</item>
                           <item>6. By a <hi>Diet,</hi> in the which there ought to be a careful and continual abſtinence from al ſorts of pulſe.</item>
                        </list> It is <hi>divided,</hi> according to the Nature and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the Cauſes. 1. One is from Cauſes altogether <hi>external,</hi> as Fear, watchings, Cares, al which exſiccate and dry up the Radical Moiſture, have in them a power ſufficient to alter and change the blood in the whol Body, and to detain the Melancholy Humor. Now then, in this caſe, <hi>Veneſection</hi> is not reputed to have any place at al. Another there is <hi>from internals,</hi> to wit, either an hereditary conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (which indeed ought not over haſtily and raſhly to be tampered withal) or elſe, from either a cold and dry, or a hot and dry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and diſpoſition of the Liver and ſpleen; in the which upon the ceſſation of the burning Cauſe, the heat likewiſe ceaſeth to be, and the thicker parts, that are cold and dry, are left to remain behind. And then, either it is <hi>with blood;</hi> (from whence proceeds a doting with laughter) or elſe, <hi>with flegm,</hi> from whence happeneth a dul ſloathfulneſs and oblivion;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56003:107"/>or with <hi>yellow choller,</hi> from whence procedeth anger, &amp;c. In the <hi>Cure</hi> a regard is likwiſe to be had unto the nature, quality and condition of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is of the <hi>Heart</hi> when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits that are bred, by reaſon of a cold and dry diſtemper, are cold, dry, and of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure nature. The <hi>Cure</hi> differeth nothing from the former.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII. Another is <hi>Hypocondriacal,</hi> when a melancholly humor, (that is ſometimes cold and ſerous or wheyiſh, or elſe oftentimes that which is aduſt and burnt in the branches of the Porta vein) is gathered together in the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria, and ſo from time to time by thoſe black melancholly vapours that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſent forth, poluteth and defileth the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits in the Brain. <hi>It is known</hi> by this that it ſeizeth the party by intervals, and at ſome certain ſeaſons; and moſt commonly in its acceſs and approach it ſurpriſeth the party ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and without any notice given; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again (and that likwiſe very frequently) it firſt of al couſeth ructures, windy belchings, together with a pain diffending and ſtreatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the ſtomach; and then by and by it introduceth great anxiety of mind, difficulty of breathing, the palpitation of the heart, the immovableneſs of the tongue, and at length a miſt and darkneſs before the Eyes, a tingling and (as it were) ringing noiſe in the Ears, and laſtly, a ſtupidity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſs in either or both of the Arms. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from a feculent and dreggy Vapor, that being collected and gotten together in the Hypochondria from a Melancholy humor flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from the <hi>Antipraxy,</hi> (as we ſo term it) or renitency of the Spleen, Liver, and Stomach; and then tending upwards toward the ſuperior parts, and forcibly ruſhing in upon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it produceth and brings in the aforeſaid Symptomes; and being tranſmitted and ſent into the brain, either by the Orifice of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or elſe by the branches of the Vena Cava (or hollow vein) it there cloudeth and darkeneth the ſpirits. For the <hi>Cure</hi> hereof ſee more in the Hypochondriacal affection.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Another is (that we cal <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terine</hi>) from the Womb, which is eaſily <hi>Diſcovered</hi> by this, that the ſick complain of a pain in their left ſide, and a manifeſt pulſe and beating in the back parts neer about the Diaphragm. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> alſo from a Vapor proceeding either from the ſuppreſſion of the Courſes, or elſe from ſome putridneſs in the ſeed. For the <hi>Cure,</hi> ſee in its proper place.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Another is that we term <hi>Erotick,</hi> as <hi>proceeding from love,</hi> which is either contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Philtres</hi> or Love potions; (and then there muſt be given,
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Vomitories</hi> of the Root of <hi>Aſarum,</hi> together with Bezoarticks, Aqua Benedicta <hi>Rulandi;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Another is that we cal <hi>Errabunda;</hi> which moſt an end uſeth to infeſt the Patient in the Month of <hi>February.</hi> In this caſe the ſick perſons abound, &amp; are even overſpread with Ulcers in their thighs; neither can they poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for an hour together take their reſt in any one place.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Madneſs is a continual motion of the mind, with an unwonted boldneſs and Fierceneſs (yet without a feaver) ariſing from a fiery heat of the Spirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>part affected</hi> is the Brain, (the memory (for the moſt part) being ſtil preſerved, and kept intire) and the Heart, which is (as it were) collected and ſtraightened by the over vehement paſſions and affections, and a dayly and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enduring of the winters cold, the heart too copiously diffuſing the natural heat.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNES are, Fierceneſs, and ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from melancholy; the want of a Symptomatically feaver; (in regard that there is here no putrefaction) and by this it is diſtinguiſhed from a Phrenſie. Unto the ſigns aforeſaid there are likewiſe often-times added extream and over watchings, (for want of reſt) and divers other ſignes, that are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe common to a deliry or dotage.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is the exceeding great and boyling heat of the Spirits; unto the which it is apparent, that of neceſſity there ought to be conjoyned an occult, ſecret, and more potent cauſe; from the enormity and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſymptoms: But now, from whence this extraordinary heat hath its original, ſhal be diſcovered, when we come to ſpeak of the differences.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>difficult,</hi> becauſe that the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56003:107"/>affect is of a long continuance, as wel by reaſon of the cauſe, (which is moſt pertinacious, and hath in it (as it were) the nature and quality of Leven) as alſo in regard of the ſick perſons, who wil by no means yeild obedience unto what is enjoyned. But there is <hi>good hope</hi> of a cure, if the courſes and hemorroides flow forth, if the Belly be looſe and ſolluble; if the ſymptoms be gentle and moderate; if there be a plentiful flux of the blood, out of the noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils, out of the greater crooked and wreathed veins of the hips, thighs &amp;c. (the Practitioners term them <hi>varices</hi>) and out of the womb; if there ſweats preſent; and laſtly, if the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be turned into a kind of ſilent decipience, or (as we ſay) playing the ſimple one.

                     <p>The <hi>differences</hi> are taken from the Cauſes that introduce exceſſive heat into the ſpirits.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is from <hi>Cauſes external,</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the extraordinary heat of the dog-days, vehement and exorbitant wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, drinking of hot and ſtrong wines, <hi>Night-ſhade,</hi> the brains of a cat and of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, wine turned by lightening, Philters or love potions, the eating of dogs and wolves; the curing of fiſtulaes and old ulcers; al which may be ſufficiently known from the relation both of the Patient, and the by-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>Another from <hi>Cauſes internal;</hi> of which more in the ſecond difference.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is from <hi>aduſt</hi> or burnt <hi>blood,</hi> which is <hi>known</hi> by the ſigns and tokens of Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory, rednes of the eyes, by playing or toying, ſinging, and exceſſve dancing, &amp;c. It <hi>ariſeth,</hi> ſometimes from a hot diſtemper of the liver, and ſometimes from the ſuppreſſion of the courſes and of the hemorrohides. The <hi>Cure</hi> is to be accompliſhed by veneſection or opening of a vein, in the mean time not neglecting thoſe diſtempers and diſeaſes by which it is cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Another is from <hi>black choler</hi> accompanyed and attended with a certain accuce and ſecret property; which is <hi>known</hi> by this in that it is perpetual if it be once lodged and hath taken up its reſidence in al the veins, or elſe at leaſt, in thoſe that are next unto the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; if the dorage be accompanied with rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if the ſtrength of the ſick be extreamly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred and weakened and in a manner diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by long continued watchings; if there be withal preſent a raging and mad deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bite and tear, &amp;c. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Raging madneſs is a deliry (or doting) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from ſome certain peculiar poyſon bread in any living creature, and communicated unto a man, with a ſtrong and vehement ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of al things that are liquid, but more eſpecially, water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Animals</hi> (or living Creatuers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) that communicate this poyſon unto man, are, the wolfe, the cat, and the dog; and cheifly this laſt.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNES are, (in the <hi>begining</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) anger ſoon moved and a continual inclyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto; a complaning of the Air, as if it were Southerly and moiſt; little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to drink; a great deſire to have candles lighted up in the day time; and laſtly, a vertigo, lightneſs, giddineſs, or ſwimming of the head. The ſigns of this diſtemper <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,</hi> are theſe; a diſtenſion of the members, but this is not continual; foaming or froathing at the mouth, frowning fierce looks, ſpitting and ſpawling upon thoſe that are nigh, a barking like as of dogs, an abhorring of, and flying from water, by reaſon of a ſingular and peculiar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy and diſlike; from whence this affect is termed (and that not improperly) the Hydrophoby.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is <hi>poyſon,</hi> that is generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a living creature, from ſom peculiar incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it hath and then comunicated unto man by breathing upon him, kiſſing, ſpitland biting. In ſome it is generated (if we may beleive <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>) from an extream terror; and in others, from touching the dog-tree (which they cal <hi>Cornus</hi>) or by the touch of bloodwort, or elſe, the <hi>Sorb</hi> or ſervice tree. But now this <hi>deliry is produced</hi> in ſome perſons ſooner, within twenty dayes at the utmoſt; but in others more ſlowly; yea even the twelfhth year after. And this commeth to paſs, either by reaſon of the variety of the part that is bitten; (for ſome of them are more noble, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againe are leſs noble) or elſe, by means of the diet that is uſed, which poſſibly may much weaken and abate the ſtrength of the poyſon; or by reaſon of the diverſity of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; or elſe, laſt of al, from the difference and Diſſimilitude of Countries, times, and ſeaſons.</p>
                     <p>There may be ſome <hi>good hope</hi> of a CURE, if the wound or hurt reacheth not unto any nerve, vein, or Arterie; and if it be not very deep. But there is ſmal, or <hi>no hope,</hi> if there be preſent a fear of water; and if ſighing or ſobbing happen thereupon. But if there be any cure, it then <hi>conſiſteth.</hi>

                        <hi>The waking Coma is a propenſion to ſleep, and yet withal an utter diſability thereunto, ariſing from Narcotick (or dul ſleepy) Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, that induce and cauſe a drowſie and ſleepy diſpoſition, and withal trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the mind.</hi>

                     <p>The SIGNS are, a Connivence or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Eyes, and yet withal a frequent opening alſo of the Eyes; a mopiſh or doting kind of diſcourſe in the Patient; and likewiſe an inordinate motion of the hands and thighs.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is conjectured to be Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick Vapors, unto the which there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned ſomthing that brings along with it a neceſſity of waking; and ſo doth a Phrenſie, a Malignant Feaver, &amp;c. It ſomtimes alſo proceedeth from an extream debility of the ſtrength and powers of the body, contracted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſome vehement Diſeaſes grievous and intolerable pains, and an exceſſive immoderate Evacuation; and then in this caſe it is very dangerous, if not deadly.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is very <hi>difficult,</hi> in regard that the affect is eaſily changed into the Leth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argy or Phrenſie.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A Lethargy is an inſatiable propenſion to ſleep, together with a gentle Feaver, forgetfulneſs, and a dul ſloathfulneſs or Lazineſs; ariſing from a Pituitous or flegmy kind of blood putrifying in the hinder nooks, windings, and Cels of the brain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>parts affected</hi> are the Poſterior or hinder ventricles and Cels of the brain; in regard that in this diſtemper the Memory is that which is cheifly hurt.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, <hi>an inſatiable deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſleep,</hi> as being never ſatisfied therewith; by reaſon that the brain through its over moiſtneſs cannot poſſibly be expanded; and becauſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Animal ſpirits are as it were bound and lock'd up, by unwonted extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary obſtructions. Another ſign is, a mild <hi>and gentle Feaver,</hi> in regard that the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Humor is not extreamly ſharp and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that the heat is allayed and qualifyed by its Contrary; but then this Feaver is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual,</hi> in regard that the heat (being as it were to boyl it up) is continued, and in a manner perpetual, and ever more, from day to day, rerturning about the beginning of the Night. Another ſign is <hi>Oblivion</hi> or forgetfulneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the hinder part of the brain is hurt. Another, <hi>ſlowneſs of breathing,</hi> in regard the Nerves of the Thorax, breaſt or Cheſt, are affected. Another, a <hi>Cough,</hi> by reaſon of the Flegms Defluxion into the Larinx, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the wide rough Artery, (we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cal it the winde-Pipe.) Another ſign is a Turbed, That is to ſay, a thick, pudled, and troubled <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin,</hi> in regard that the Crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are agitated and driven about by the hear, and yet are not ſeparated. Another ſign is, <hi>great Pulſes,</hi> by reaſon of the Feaver that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyeth it; but then ſuch as are not very quick and frequent, but <hi>ſlow,</hi> by reaſon of the imbecillity of the Natural ſtrength and powers of the Body. <hi>It differeth</hi> from the <hi>Catalepſie,</hi> by the winking and ſhutting cloſe of the Eyes; from <hi>Carus,</hi> by the Feaver that is preſent herewith; from the <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> becauſe it doth not ſuddenly, and al at once invade the party; neither doth it deprive of al kind of motion: It differeth from the <hi>Hyſterical Paſſion</hi> (we term this affect the fits of the Mother) in that the Lethargical perſons are able to ſpeak and make anſwer (the others not ſo) and withal they are affected with a moderate and gentle Feaver: and laſtly it differeth from <hi>Coma,</hi> by that exceſſive and inſatiable deſire of ſleep (of the which they have never enough) and out of which they are no ſooner rouzed &amp; awakened, but they immediatly fal back again there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is Flegm or ſnivel, rotting and putrifying in the hinder parts, (we uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cal them the ventricles, nooks, and Cels) of the Brain. <hi>Where</hi> it is to be noted as <hi>Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>

                        <hi>A Laſſitude is a certain unaptneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs (together with a certain kind of pain) unto the exerciſe of the Animal motion, which ought to have been performed freely and in a natural way.</hi>

                     <p>As for the ſigns, the relation of the ſick party wil ſufficiently acquaint us with them.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is, whatſoever doth burthen, weary, and make Lither the Muſcles that are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56003:109"/>the inſtruments of the Animal Motion; whether it be any thing External or Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is accompliſhed by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Cauſes, and likewiſe by the cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting of the Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>divided</hi> into ſix <hi>Species</hi> or kinds.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is that that is <hi>not Spontaneous</hi> or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary: unto which, that we term <hi>Exſiccative,</hi> doth appertain. Another is <hi>Spontaneous</hi> or voluntary; which (in regard that it ſignifieth and manifeſtly declareth that Humors ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound in the body) may therefore not unfitly be ſaid to preſage Diſeaſes; and if it perſevere and continue after the ceſſation of the Feaver, it ſignifieth a certainty, or at leaſt an extream danger of falling back into a relapſe. And unto this kind belongeth that we cal <hi>Gracility <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous, tenſive, Phlegmonodes,</hi> and <hi>Oſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos.</hi>

                     <p n="2">II. Another is that which we cal <hi>Exſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which proceedeth from an extream and over great motion of the body. But in this there is no danger at al, unleſs it chance to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal a Cacochymical body. It is cured, I. by reſt, eſpecially that reſt that is taken in ſleep, becauſe that then the members are placed in a middle kind of frame and poſture, upon the Relaxation of the Muſcles. II. By Exerciſe, if it be more moderate than the former, in regard that it diſcuſſeth and diſperſeth thoſe Humors that are moved up and down throughout the Cavity of the whol body.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is that we term a Laſſitude of <hi>Gracility,</hi> which hath accompanying it no grievous or diſquieting ſenſe of pain. It ariſeth from a Conſumption of the fleſh and Fat of the muſcles. It followeth upon either Chronical or elſe (it may be) after ſome acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. It is to <hi>be Cured</hi> by a Convenient Diet.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Another is <hi>ulcerous;</hi> which is <hi>known</hi> by the ſigns and tokens of a cholerick cacochymy, by a ſenſible pricking and ſhooting throughout the whol body (from whence indeed it taketh its name and denomination) and by a kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream and vehement ſtifneſs that enſueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. It <hi>hath its Original</hi> from ſome ſharp and biting (either) Humor or Vapor; or elſe from heat diffuſed and diſperſed to and fro, or elſe ſuch as is wholly diſſolved, waſted, and conſumed by exceſſive and inordinate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. <hi>It is Cured by Purgation,</hi> if it be ſo that the matter fix and ſtick in the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and deep parts; but by frictions, and motion, if the matter be only in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies.</p>
                     <p n="5">V.

It <hi>hath its riſe,</hi> either from a <hi>great abundance of blood</hi> fallen forth of the Veins unto the muſcles, or elſe ſuch as is attracted and drawn together by overmuch and violent exerciſe; and then the Cure is to be performed by Veneſection or blood-letting: or otherwiſe it ariſeth from the Humors that are in the manner and by the means aforeſaid drawn and led along thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in this caſe there wil be great need of Purgation.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The laſt is that we cal <hi>Oſtocopos,</hi> which is <hi>known</hi> by the extenſion and ſtretching out of the interior Nerves adhering unto the bones of the Tendons, and encompaſſing and wrapping about the bones of the Membranes. <hi>It proceedeth</hi> from black choler or Melancholy ſeizing upon and poſſeſſing thoſe Membranes. It uſually concurreth and ſheweth it ſelf together with the Scurvy, Quartane Feavers, and the French Diſeaſe. The <hi>Cure</hi> ought primarily and cheifly to be directed and inſtituted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cure of the aforeſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Rigor or unnatural vehement ſtifneſs is a vibration, ſhaking, and quavering of the Muſcles of the whol body, conjoyned with Refrigeration, and a certain pain, ariſing from ſomthing that doth moleſt, by a ſuddain and unlookt for twinging and pulling of the ſenſible parts throughout the whol Circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the body; and likewiſe by Irritating and</hi> ſtirring up the expulſive faculty.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Part affected</hi> is the whol body, or at leaſt, the Muſcles of the ſame, whether they ſuffer together more inwardly, or not.</p>
                     <p>There is no need of <hi>Signs;</hi> the Refrigeration that happeneth herein, either it is of the Skin alone, by reaſon of a pain excited and ſtirred up by the acrimony and ſharpneſs of an humor; or elſe it is alſo of the Muſcles; whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Diffuſion of the Humor, or otherwiſe from the Inflamation of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is ſomthing that is grievous and burthenſom; whether it be collected and contained in the very Muſcles themſelves; or elſe be tranſmitted thither from ſome other place. But now then the ſaid matter is ſharp, corroding and biting, much of it in quantity, and ſuch as is ſwiftly moved and carryed up and down from place to place. And this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth moſt eſpecially in Feavers.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is accompliſhed by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and taking away of the cauſes. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, (if it ceaſe not upon the uſe of an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation) is very evil and dangerous; and ſo likewiſe if it be attended and accompanied with a Conſumption, and waſting of the whol body.</p>
                     <p>It is cheifly and eſpecially <hi>divided</hi> in a threefold manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One kind (or ſpecies) hereof is from <hi>things External;</hi> as for inſtance, a cold Air, or an External heat diffuſing and diſſipating the Excrements that before were at reſt, and were quiet, without any moleſtation; ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of cold water, upon the body; the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a ſpark of fire upon the skin, &amp;c. The <hi>Cure</hi> here hath nothing in it worthy of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Another there is that proceedeth from <hi>Cauſes Internal;</hi> to wit, a Cholerick humor, a ſalt Flegm, Melancholy, black choler, and acrimonious ſharp Vapor. The Cure hath reſpect unto the ſeveral ſorts of the Diſeaſe. Al the kinds of them are ſomtimes <hi>to be Mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> with the Oyl of <hi>Rue,</hi> of <hi>Bay-berries,</hi> of <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and of the <hi>ſeveral ſorts of Pepper,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Treacle</hi> and <hi>Mithridate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is <hi>vehement with a continual fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> and then, if it chance to be in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it betokeneth an inflamation of ſome bowel; but if in the end, it ſheweth, either that the feaveriſh matter is moved out of the Veins, or that the Inflamation tendeth to a Suppuration: Another is but <hi>little,</hi> and not much conſiderable, being ſuch as only giveth notice of Feavers to follow; of which ſee further in theſe Chapters wherein they are particularly treated of.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is <hi>Periodical,</hi> which afflicteth the party but now and then, and by fitts at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons. And this is the beſt and the moſt hopeful ſpecies of this Diſeaſe, if it happen to appear on the Critical day; if upon its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the body waxeth hot; or elſe that any Evacuation of excrements follow thereupon. Another is <hi>Symptomatical,</hi> when as the matter is thruſt forth into the external parts, and the Circumference of the body, without any <hi>Criſis</hi> at al; and this is that of which we are now ſpeaking.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>This Trembling is a depravation of the Voluntary motion, (by reaſon of the which the Member elevated and lift up cannot be kept in its own proper ſituation) ariſing from the debility and weakneſs of the faculty of motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no need of SIGNS: <hi>It Differeth</hi> from a <hi>Convulſion,</hi> becauſe in this latter the part is contracted, and ſo kept; from a <hi>Palſie,</hi> becauſe that in this the part is ſeldom or never lifted up, or at leaſt very ſlowly; from a <hi>Palpitation,</hi> in regard that in this not the whol Member, but the fleſh, and eſpecially the Skin is moved; and the member unmoved, one while falleth down, and again another while is diſtended and ſtretched forth; and laſtly, it differeth from the <hi>Rigor</hi> or ſtifneſs aforeſaid, in regard that it is without any pain.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is a weakneſs of the moving faculty, which happeneth either by a default in the Animal ſpirits, or the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>CURE there is <hi>none,</hi> if it befal thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are in yeers, by reaſon of the extream imbecillity and weakneſs of the ſpirits and the brain; if it happen in a vehement Phrenſie, or Melancholy; for then it is cauſed, either by means of the exſiccation or overgreat drying of the Nerves by a Feaver, or elſe by reaſon of a corrupt and depraved quality: if it be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, or that it proceed from ſome fault and diſorder in point of diet, eſpecially in ſuch that have the Organs of the Animal faculty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weakened; if the ſick perſon Shrink and Start when he is toucht; in acute Feavers, becauſe that the Nerves are either exſiccated and over dried, or elſe are pulled and twinged by ſome depraved and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated matter, upon which there followeth a Convulſion. The Cure is more <hi>facile</hi> and eaſie, if it proceed from Cauſes that are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. It is <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>difficult,</hi> if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on the leſt ſide, in regard that then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat heat of that part is the more eaſily impaired and made to decay; if it turn into a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe then the peccant matter aſſumeth unto it ſelf and worſe and more offenſive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; if it happen to be in a burning Feaver, and that a doting follow thereupon; for then ſome great and grievous Diſeaſe ſucceedeth, and the ſtrength, and powers of the body are waſted and conſumed; if the ſick party Shrink and Start when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">I.

                     <p>Another there is from ſome <hi>faults</hi> and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the <hi>Nerves</hi> themſelves; which may be, I.

For thoſe Remedies that are <hi>taken inwardly,</hi> theſe following are cheifly commended, VIZ. The Eſſence of Balm, and ſtoechas of Arabia.

                     <p>The CAUSE is a defect and fayling of the Animal ſpirits, which happeneth by ſome fault of the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>There is <hi>no</hi> CURE at al to be expected, if it chance to be from an extream and forcible Relaxation or Looſing of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that then the Nerves are greatly cruſhed together and very much bruiſed, inſomuch that an inflamation followeth thereupon; if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an inciſion or cutting of ſome one of the greater Nerves, or the the ſpinal Marrow, becauſe there is then no Hope of a Coalition or cloſing together again of the inciſion. The Cure is likewiſe exceeding <hi>Difficult</hi> and hard to be effected, if it happen unto aged people, in regard that it denoteth an imbicillity of the heat; if the member be extenuated, and the natural vegetative heat thereof be changed and altered; eſpecially if the eye on that ſide be impaired, becauſe it argueth then that the heat is wel nigh extinguiſhed, if there be many of the nerves and muſcles affected; if it ſucceed and follow upon an Appoplexy, in regard that then the cauſe is over vehement. But the Cure is <hi>more eaſie,</hi> if the reſolution be in the thinges or feet, becauſe that in thoſe parts the nature and conſtitution of the nerves is dryer than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; if the member reſolved and looſened be actually hot; and laſtly; if a trembling, or a feaver follow upon it. It is to be inſtituted and ordayned, according to the nature of the cauſes, and the differences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>differences</hi> of a palſy are very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> in the which either the whole body (the head alone excepted) is ſeized upon, or at leaſt, the one halfe thereof or one ſide of it. And then, if the <hi>Face</hi> be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the brain alſo, (together with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marrow) is affected: <hi>But if al the parts beneath the face,</hi> then the begining and firſt entrance into the ſpinal marrow (which we cal the marrow of the back bone) is very far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in its tranſverſe ſituation: but if the affect ſurpriſe only <hi>the one half</hi> of the body, one ſide then only of the Said ſpinal marrow is likewiſe affected, and becometh faulty.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>particular,</hi> when alone ſome one certain part ſuffereth. And then, if the <hi>Arms</hi> and hands be deprived of their motion, then the nerves that proceed forth from the <hi>vertebre</hi> of the hinder part of the neck, offend and are faulty. If the <hi>Feet,</hi> then thoſe nerves that are in the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns, and the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> or channel bone. If the <hi>eyes,</hi> then the ſecond pair of nerves is affected, If the <hi>Tongue,</hi> then the ſeventh payr of the nerves is affected. And laſtly if the voice fail, then thoſe nerves that are called <hi>recurrentis,</hi> they only are affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and do ſuffer.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another difference there is, ariſing from a diſtemper in the <hi>nerves</hi> themſelves, by reaſon of phlegmy and cold humors, that <hi>relax</hi> or <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> and diſſolve <hi>their</hi> tone: and theſe for the moſt part deſcend from the head. Theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may be <hi>known</hi> and more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what they are, out of the Chapter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtemper of the head. The <hi>Cure</hi> is to be wrought,
<list>
                           <item>1. by a gentle evacuation and imploying of the firſt and moſt principal paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, leaſt that otherwiſe the preparatives draw the crude humors into the ſtomach; (and here <hi>vomiting</hi> procured and excited by the uſe of <hi>Crato</hi> his vomitary made of the <hi>Juyce of the reddiſh</hi> in the which <hi>black hellebor</hi> hath bin ſteeped and infuſed, hath its place if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be ſtuffed ful of flegm) but then if the matter be in its flux and motion, the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be ſo much the <hi>ſtronger.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Another is from the <hi>ſtraightneſs</hi> or narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Nerves;</hi> which is cauſed,
<list>
                           <item>1. By an <hi>obſtruction,</hi> proceeding from a pituitous flegmy humor, and other things that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient hereunto, and conducing unto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe aforeſaid.

                     <p>Another is from <hi>things narcotick,</hi> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, a touching of the ſea fiſh <hi>Torpido,</hi> quick-ſilver, and the immoderate unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able drinking of wine, which rendereth the ſpirits extreamly ſtupid and dul: and here in the cure whereof there ought to be a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had unto the nature and quallity of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A Spaſm is an involuntary, perpetual, and painful Retraction (or drawing back) of the Muſcles towards the place of their original and firſt beginning, ariſing from the abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and ſhortening of the nervous (or ſinewy) parts; which is evermore attended and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a Rigor or Extream ſtifneſs, and a depravation of the figure, ſhape, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of the foreſaid parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>part affected</hi> is a Muſcle, and eſpecially a Tendon.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNES are apparent of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the Muſcles are in ſuch manner drawn back, that the parties are altogether immovable toward, and unto the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, either a certain matter pulling and twinging the expulſive facculty of the parts; or elſe ſome diſeaſe voilently ſtretching out the nervous parts: and this ſticketh faſt either in the beginning and ſourſe of the nerves (to wit, the Brain) or in the Spinal marrow, of elſe in ſome one peculiar nerve.</p>
                     <p>There is hardly any CURE to be had, or hoped for, if it be from hellebore; if it ariſe and appear after a Phrenſy; if it proceed from a wound, eſpecially in the brain, by reaſon of a filthy ſtinking and corrupt matter pulling and twinging the nerves. The Cure is <hi>very difficult</hi> (although not altogether without hopes) if thoſe parts that are ſituate neer unto the brain be affected, and ſuffer; if it happen primarily by the conſent of ſome nerve, in regard that then the ſick perſon cannot poſſibly hold out and endure by reaſon of the vehemency of the Symptoms; if it ariſe from an abundant flux of blood; if it follow upon the monthly Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in women; if it attend and follow upon feavers; or if it chance to be accompanyed with vehement and accute pains about the bowels or intrals. It is <hi>more eaſie,</hi> if thoſe parts only
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56003:112"/>are ſurprized and ſiezed upon that are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the brain, and conſequently the leſs noble and conſiderable; if it be by the conſent of the Brain, unleſs the affect that the brain lyeth and laboureth under, be pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, obſtinate, and unyielding. The Cure ought therefore to <hi>be Inſtituted,</hi> according to the Nature and diſpoſition of the Cauſes; of which more fully in the Differences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of a Spaſm are very many and Various.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> which affecteth the whol body. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> whereof, either, <hi>It is in the Brain,</hi> and then together with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Muſcles likewiſe of the Face are alſo drawn and pulled together, and ſuffer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, or elſe it is in the <hi>Original and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>the Spinal Marrow,</hi> from whence it happeneth that the Muſcles that move the Head and the ſpinal Marrow are retracted and drawn back. And then, either the body (with the Neck and Head) is drawn to the inner parts, (from whence ariſeth that we term <hi>Emproſthotonos:</hi>) or elſe the twelve Mulcles that extend the Head being affected, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parts are drawn backward, (from whence is that we cal <hi>Opiſthotonos:</hi>) or otherwiſe the Muſcles and Nerves (as wel the anterior as the poſterior) being al of them affected, the whol body remayneth altogether inflexible and unmoveable: from whence ariſeth that we cal <hi>Tetanos,</hi> with the which whoſoever are affected, either they die within four daies; or elſe if they paſs and out-live theſe, they then eſcape and recover. Another is <hi>Particular,</hi> of the Eye, Mouth, &amp;c. Of which we ſhal ſee further in the proper place.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is from <hi>Replexion;</hi> which dilateth the breadth of the Nerves, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Longitude thereof. <hi>It is known</hi> by the foregoing of the Cauſes, a ſudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion and ſurpriſal without any evident and manifeſt Cauſe, and exhaſting, together with a Flegmatick habit and temperament. <hi>It ariſeth,</hi>

                           <item>I.

Then there went before it ſuch a like kind of Diet, and the monthly Courſes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoides, or other wonted Evacuations are ſuppreſſed. In the <hi>Cure,</hi>

                                 <item>2. We ought to Evacuate oftentimes with the milder and gentler ſort of Medicaments; the ſtronger ſort of them pour out, and quite expel the matter.</item>
                                 <item>3. A Revulſion muſt be made by frictions, Gargariſms, Cupping-Glaſſes, &amp;c.</item>
                                 <item>4.

                           <item>III. From extream windineſſes: and then the Cauſes thereof, went before and it ſoon paſſeth away, &amp; is gone. <hi>To Diſcuſs, Vervein</hi> and <hi>Mother-wort,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Neck, are very available.</item>

                     <p>Another is from <hi>Inanition,</hi> or extream emptineſs, in which the Nerves are rendered and made ſhorter by reaſon of the exſiccation and ſudden drying up of the Native Rudical Humidity. <hi>It is known</hi> from hence, that it maketh its approach ſenſibly and by degrees, with a diminution of the member. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from Cauſes, that do either exceſſively evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, ſuch as are, frequent and much bleeding at the Noſe, ſweats, and purgations with Hellebore; or elſe they vehemently heat, and dry up the radical Moyſture; and ſuch are, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, watchings, hard labor and over working, the drinking of much wine, immoderate and exceſſive venery, a long laſting pain, the Hectick Feaver, and laſtly, Cauteries or Veſicatories over frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the Nervous parts.

                     <p>Another is that we cal <hi>Phuſodes,</hi> which hath its original from a groſs and thick ſpirit or Vapor, (excited by Crudities,) that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out the ſpaces of the Muſcles, and diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them with a grievons pain.

                     </p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> (as we term it) which proceedeth from the exſtimulation, goading (as I may ſo ſay) and pricking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Nervous parts by ſome painful affect, but yet without a perpetual extenſion and ſtretching forth of the ſaid parts, &amp; for the moſt part it happeneth by conſent of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomach, or of the Womb.

                     </p>
                     <p>Incubus <hi>(the Night-haggs) is an intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the motion, eſpecially that of breathing, and the Voice, with a falſe and Erroneous dream of ſome heavy and weighty thing lying along upon the Breaſt, and thereby cauſing a ſuffocation (as it were) and choaking of the Party, by means of the impeding and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the free penetration of the ſpirit (the Paſſages being obſtructed and ſtopt) unto the Nerves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>part affected</hi> is the Brain, eſpeacially in the hinder part thereof, by which the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage reacheth and attaineth unto the beginning of the ſpinal Marrow. The <hi>Diaphragm</hi> is likewiſe compreſſed, and kept down.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, a heavineſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movableneſs of the body, and cheifly the Cheſt or Breaſt, a ſlow and dul ſenſe, and imagination and conceit of a ſuffocation, (eſpecially in the firſt beginning of ſleep, &amp; the party lying upon the back) and as it were an oppreſſion and keeping down by ſomwhat lying heavy upon it; inſomuch that the Patient can by no means diſtinctly cal and cry out, but only make a confuſed and unintelligible Noiſe. The alone interception of breathing and the voice is brought and offered unto the imagination; in regard that the motion of the breaſt alone is mainly and principally neceſſary in the time of ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, an interception of the Animal ſpirits, ariſing from a light <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Ventricles of the brain, and more eſpecially of the beginning of the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. That that Cauſeth this obſtruction is a <hi>Groſs</hi> and <hi>thick Vapor,</hi> that is oftentimes cold, yea even Narcotick; and hence it cometh to paſs, that the party thus affected is ſo hardly awakened. That which proceedeth from a groſs and thick Flegm, or from a Melancholy Humor ſticking faſt in the Hypochondria, and neer about the Precordia, this (in theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) from Gluttony, furfetting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (the ſtomach being thereby ſur-charged) from Crudities, or other ſuch like Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwoln and puffed up, and then moved, exhaleth and compreſſeth the Diaphragm and the Lungs, ruſheth violently into the beginning and enterance of the Nerves, and ſo creeping (as it were) and inſinuating it ſelf into the very ſeat of the Imagination, there intermingleth it ſelf with the ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is the leſs to be hoped for, if from an internal cauſe it fieze upon thoſe that are wel in yeers; if it be of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and frequent, and ſuch as after which the ſick perſon remayneth ſtupid and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; if it happen unto the party while he is half aſleep and half awake, becauſe that then it cometh the neerer to the Epilepſie or falling ſickneſs; if after the awakening a cold ſweat, a trembling of the heart, a ſpaſm, convulſion; or a ſyncope follow thereupon. <hi>It reſpecteth,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Epilepſie is a Ceſſation of the Animal and principal actions, together with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motion of the whol Body, ariſing from a ſharp matter, which by a peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power and quality, it hath, that is hurtful and Prejudicial to the Brain, pulling and twinging the Nerves where they begin, ſtreightening, and as it were binding them faſt together, and Irritating them unto Expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe called the <hi>Puerile,</hi> or Childiſh Diſeaſe, the <hi>Herculean,</hi> the <hi>Comitial</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, (or the Falling Sickneſs) the <hi>Lunatick, divine, Sontick,</hi> or noyſom and hurtful, and laſtly, Caducus, or the falling Evil.</p>
                     <p>The Signs are, either of one <hi>Imminent</hi> and night at hand, and theſe are, the trembling and quivering (as it were) of the Nerves, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours and birght ſhinings like unto the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow flying and waving to and fro before the Eyes, the ſenſe and ſmelling of ſome offenſive ſtench, the Vertigo, and the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the Veins under the Tongue; or alſe of <hi>one Preſent,</hi> and theſe ſigns are, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den falling, a <hi>Contorſion</hi> (as they cal it) or writhing of the Members of the Face, very improportionate unto, (or bearing no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withal) the matter thereof, a kind of Roaring and Howling noyſe that they make, the guting, and cloſe claſhing together (or as they cal it, Colliſion) of the Teeth, the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and faſt holding together of the Fingers, an involuntary and inſenſible letting out of the Urin, and ſending forth the other filth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, foaming and froathing like unto the white of an Egg, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, either a <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>froathy Humor,</hi> or Vapor, the which whileſt that they (by a peculiar and proper power and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is in them) twing and pul in the brain the principal of the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iminution or total abolition of the aforeſayd ſenſifical Spirits. And from hence it is, that al the parts ſuffer a convulſive motion. That which <hi>diſpoſeth</hi> hereunto is either (by propagation and <hi>inheritance</hi>) from the parents; or elſe from their nativity, when as they have their birth in and during the Lunar Eclipſe. That which fomenteth and maketh an abundant ſupply of the <hi>matter,</hi> is, the frequent uſe of Goats liver and Goats fleſh; of Quailes that devour and feed much upon helebor, pigeons when they are ſomwhat old, Eels, ſparrows, al kind of Pulſe, Lentiles, &amp;c. that it moveth and much promoteth the ſame, is the moon beams, the ſmelling of offenſive and noyſome ſtinks, the ſcent or ſmel of that fat and clammy earth that we cal Bitumen, of the Agath or Jeat ſtone, of Goats horns, harts horns, Goats skin, Myrh, Sulfur, Garlick, ſmallage, &amp;c. an extraordinary ſtrong and vehement feare, much tikling, and laſtly, the impulſe of the divel, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is the <hi>more difficult,</hi> if al the Functions be aboliſhed, if the convulſion be ſtronger and more vehement than ordinary, and of a longer cotinuance, and that withal the Excrements flow forth of their own accord; if it happen before ripeneſs of years, and if it infeſt old and decriped perſons; if it invade women with child. It is <hi>eaſier,</hi> if it be but now beginning, if it hath ſhorter Paroxyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, a convulſion not extreamly vehement, if the ſick party hath his breathing freely. But theris <hi>almoſt no</hi> cure to be hoped for, if it be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, if it grieviouſly afflict little infants, if upon the uſe of ſternutatories the ſick Party yet cannot be made to ſneez.

                     <p>The <hi>differences</hi> of an Epilepſie are very various.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is that we terme <hi>Recent,</hi> or new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun which if it be neglected in the begining, moſt commonly it dieth together with them that are deteyned and kept under the power of it. Another is that we cal <hi>inveterate,</hi> which whether or no it may be cured, is for the moſt part very doubtful and uncertain.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is that which is <hi>more mild</hi> and moderate, in which only ſome certain parts are drawn together and ſuffer a Convulſion; and the ſick perſon when he cometh again to himſelfe, as we ſay, is wholy ignorant of al that he did. Another is more ſad and <hi>greivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> in which there is a Concuſſion and convulſion of the whole Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is that we term <hi>Periodical,</hi> which invadeth and ſeizeth the party once or twice in every year, or it may be, every month (at the new and ful moon) or perhaps oftener, but yet evermore at thoſe times and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals as it was alwaies wont to keep. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that which <hi>keepeth not,</hi> neither obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>any periods,</hi> But afflicteth and ſurpriſeth the patient, ſomtimes more rarely, and ſomtimes again often, and frequently.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII. Another is that which is ſuch <hi>in its own eſſence,</hi> to wit, when there is an epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſpoſition in the very brain. It <hi>is known</hi> by this, that a man ſuddenly fals down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt pre-apprehenſion and ſenſe of its paroxiſm, and that when he returneth to himſelfe he remembereth not any one thing of what was done, and laſtly, that he is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herewith chiefly and principally (to which <hi>I</hi> may likewiſe ad, very frequently) about the new and ful of the Moon. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> and hath its firſt birth from thoſe very ſame cauſes of which we have ſpoken above; and it is alſo to be <hi>Cured</hi> in the ſelf ſame maner. If there there be any need of veneſection, then let the Cephalick vein in the Elbow be opened; and here likewiſe fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels or iſſues, and thoſe external and manual remedies which practitioners cal ſetacea, are of ſingular uſe. In this difference alone there may be a cautery applied unto the Coronal fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It ſomtimes <hi>hapeneth by reaſon of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume in the brain;</hi> and ſometimes from the <hi>corruption</hi> of the <hi>Meninges</hi> or Membranes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſomtimes again by means of a <hi>rotten and putrified skul,</hi> a <hi>wound,</hi> &amp;c. touching which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hath been already ſayd in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Another is by <hi>Conſent</hi> or agreement with ſome other parts, when the cauſe being before produced and begotten in the inferior parts is lifted up into the head, and there exciteth an Epilepſie. It is <hi>known</hi> by this, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm when it is nigh approaching may be perceived and foreknown; and a certain kind of air (as it were) aſcending from an inferior part, there is a pain perceived in ſome one part or other; and then the ſick perſon returning to himſelfe remembereth the paroxyſm. The <hi>Cure</hi> is to be ordered according to that part that moſt requireth and commendeth it, and the matter that tendeth upwards is to be drawn back again. It is variouſly <hi>divided;</hi> of which we ſhal ſpeak more in the following difference.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Another is <hi>from the ſtomach;</hi> in the which the ſick perſons fal into the epilipſie: if they take not their food often, then there are preſent ſignes and tokens of a diſtempered and affected ſtomach. In the cure, we may ſafely and ſucceſsfuly have recourſe unto vom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>from worms,</hi> which are eaſily diſcovered by their ſignes. Unto ſcolecobro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Medicaments there ought to be added and therewith mingled Antepileptical remedies.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>from the womb;</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that there is then ſome affect or other of the Womb preſent; to wit, the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, the retention of the Seed, or the Secundines, a dead childe in the womb, &amp;c. The Cure is to be directed and to look toward the Affects in the which the root of round ariſtolochy is much commended. <hi>Note</hi> here, that the water of ſwallowes diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Caſtoreum, Galbanum, and vinegar, is moſt proper and convenient; that for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man great with child there ought not upon any termes ſweet ſmelling odoriferous things be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied or laid neer unto her wombe; yea like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that al odoriferous medicaments, ſince
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56003:115"/>they offend the Head and make it heavy, are wel removed from it.</p>
                     <p>Another is from <hi>the External parts,</hi> either wounded, or ulcerated, or elſe hurt by biting, which is exactly and diligently to be examined and inquired into, left that otherwiſe it ſhould be miſtaken for that which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Womb. It is to be Cured according to the Nature and quality of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Another is of ſuch as <hi>are grown up,</hi> and have attained to maturity of yeers; unto whom al that hath hitherto been ſpoken upon this ſubject, is to be applied as moſt ſuting and agreeing unto them.</p>
                     <p>Another is of <hi>Infants,</hi> in the <hi>Cure</hi> of which, if they be yet <hi>ſucking</hi> at the Breaſt, in the <hi>Paroxyſm</hi> we muſt then proceed ſo as is above declared; only there muſt be ſpecial Care and regard had unto the tenderneſs of their Age. Out of the <hi>Paroxyſm,</hi> the Nurſe ought (as far as neceſſity requireth) to have appropriate Medicaments given her to drink; and withal the Infant is to be Evacuated and emptyed with <hi>Syrup de Tribus</hi> (as the ſhops cal it) and then his brain is to be ſtrengthened, and the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtums, (if any there be that break out) are by no means to be hindered in their flux, but on the contrary, they are by al means poſſible to be furthered. There are ſome that (in this caſe) do very much commend the anoynting of the whol Body with <hi>Butter unwaſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalted, and Mingled with Rue bruiſed and beaten in a Mortar.</hi> An approved Remedy to preſerve from this ſad and fearful affect, is, the <hi>preſerving power</hi> of Hartman, the <hi>Aqua Vitae that is</hi> uſually <hi>Exhibited</hi> and given <hi>unto Women with Child; Oyl of ſweet Almonds with Sugar,</hi> given to Childeren new born. In that Difference that is by conſent; there is to be highly commended the Emplaſter of <hi>White Amber, of Frankincenſe, and of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, of each one dram and an half, of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, Opoponax, of each one ſcruple, of Birdlime of the Oak two drams, Amber ſix grains, Musk three grains, Male Peony ſeed half a dram, Ladanum a dram and half, of the Oyl of Nutmeg a ſmal</hi> quantity, al theſe aforeſaid being ſtrewed over with the pouder of Cubebs, the emplaſter muſt be ſpread upon leather, and ſo impoſed upon the Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or lower belly. But if <hi>(in Women)</hi> it happen, as many times it doth, from <hi>the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of the Milk,</hi> then that which is of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe is a Cataplaſme formed of <hi>Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves (three parts) boyled in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine of a Child, with two ounces of butter new and freſh,</hi> and then applied unto the Region of the ſtomach. The Cure of <hi>Children that are weaned</hi> differeth not much from thoſe before mentioned.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Carus is a deep and profound ſleep, with the hurt of the ſenſe, and motion, (the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing only excepted) and likewiſe the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ariſing from the impeded motion of the Animal ſpirits.</hi>

                     <p>The SIGNS are, ſleep (with the Eyes alwaies ſhut) ſo profound, that the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being asked never ſo many queſtions, yet anſwereth nothing at al; and ſo it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a Catalepſie and a Lethargy: a retraction or drawing back of the Member if it be pricked, which is not done in the Apoplexy; a free reſpiration and breathing, unleſs the vehemency of the Cauſe be moſt extream and intenſe.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is the prohibition and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the influence and exerciſe of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits upon the ſenſes and the Motion; of which the divers and different Cauſes ſhal be declared in the ſubſequent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                     <p>CURE there is <hi>None,</hi> if it chance in the declining of continual Feavers, the ſtrength and powers of the body being extreamly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened. It is of much <hi>difficulty,</hi> if the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be hurt; if it be Joyned together with the heavineſs of the Head, becauſe that, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor not over groſs and thick penetrating into the ſubſtance of the Nerves and extending them, immediatly a Convulſion followeth; and laſtly, if it befal the party after ſome great Evacuation. It is <hi>Accompliſhed</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quality and condition of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>divided</hi> five manner of waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">I.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Apoplexy is a ſudden abolition of al the Animal functions, the breathing alone remayning, (and this likewiſe now and then exceedingly afflicted) ariſing from the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhutting up of the Paſſages, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the baſis of the Brain) by the which the Animal Spirits are derived unto the Members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>part affected</hi> is the Brain, not only according to the ventricles thereof; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe according to its pores, and eſpecially neer about the inferior and hinder part thereof, where the Nerves begin and take their Original.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are (of an Apoplexy <hi>immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> and nigh at hand) ſomtimes none at al, ſomtimes a lightneſs and ſwimming in the head (which we uſually cal the <hi>Vertigo</hi>) dimneſs of the Eyes, and welinigh loſs of ſight, the Incubus or Night-hagg, a trembling of the whol body, the grating of the Teeth in ſleep, an extream coldneſs of the External Parts, an abundance of Snot and Snivel, the heavineſs of the Head, &amp;c. The ſigns of an Apoplexy <hi>Preſent,</hi> are, the abolition of the ſenſe and motion, and this ſuddenly and with ſnorting; and by this it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Curus,</hi> that it is without a Feaver and excitation, and ſo it is differenced from a <hi>Lethargy;</hi> that it is with a Relaxation and looſneſs of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, a ful pulſe, and the Face reteyning ſtil its color; and thus it is diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Syncope,</hi> and the <hi>Suffocation of the Womb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is, the ſtreightneſs or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the turnings and windings, and of the pores of the Brain, (eſpecially of the Baſis thereof, and of the <hi>Rete admirabile</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,) as it effecteth a ſhutting up, or ſhutting in of the ſpirits.

                  <p n="1">I. That we cal <hi>Trachoma,</hi> or a certain roughneſs of the internal part of the Eye-Lids. <hi>It is known,</hi> by the redneſs thereof, the itching, and (as it were) the ſticking out of Millet grains. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from an aduſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56003:118"/>that is, Salt, ſharp, and biting; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes likewiſe, from over ſharp Collyries. <hi>It is Cured</hi> by the Evacuation of the body; by the averting and turning away of the matter by Repercuſſives; by the application of Topical, firſt thoſe that we cal Emollient or mollitying, and qualifying the Acrimony of the peccant humor; and then by and by ſuch Topicks as cleanſe; as for inſtance, <hi>Aloes diſſolved in Roſe Water, and Myrrh diſſolved in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Breaſt Milk;</hi> which ought now and then to be intermitted, leſt that they over forcibly make an impreſſion of their ſtrength upon the Eyes; and by rubbing of the Eye-Lid inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and turned the inſide outward with Sugar Candy, even until the blood follow. <hi>It is divided</hi> in a two-fold manner.
<list>
                        <item>I. Into that we cal <hi>Daſutes,</hi> in which the Eye-Lids are only red, rough, and itching; <hi>Sycoſis,</hi> in the which there are ſticking out as it were the ſmal grains or ſeeds of Figgs; <hi>Tyloſis,</hi> in which the part being exulcerated contracteth to it ſelf a ſciſſure, and calloſity or an inſenſible hard and thick Skin; and that we term <hi>Pſorophthalmia,</hi> or a ſcab of the Eye, which affecteth the whol Eye-Lid, and ſpecially toward the corners of the Eyes, and this is Cured, (Univerſal and general Remedies being firſt premiſed) by a Liniment of Roſes, and adding thereto a very little of Tuty prepared.</item>
                        <item>II. It is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which hath its original from the <hi>blood;</hi> in which the itching is not ſo great as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; from yellow <hi>Choler,</hi> in which there are ſmal puſtules or puſhes; from <hi>Salt Flegm,</hi> out of which there paſſeth forth more of the ſerous or wheyiſh humor; and laſtly, from <hi>black Choler</hi> or Melancholy in the which that which cometh forth is diſcoloured, Black, and Blewiſh.</item>

The ſecond Malady and affect of the Eye-Lids, is that we cal <hi>Emphyſema,</hi> a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or ſwelling of the Eye-Lids; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, either from <hi>external Cauſes,</hi> to wit, the ſpiders touch, the ſtinging of the waſp, the Bee, or the Nettle (and then a Bee bruiſed and beaten to pieces is to be impoſed upon the place) Treacle, and the Juyce Of Plantaine, are to be ſpread; and the place anoynted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

                     <p>THe Parts Conſtituting the Eye, either they are the Tunicles, Viz. <hi>Adnata, Cornea, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and <hi>Aranea;</hi> or elſe they are the Humors thereof.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Ophthalmy is an inflamation of the</hi> Adnata <hi>Tunicle, ariſing from a ſharp blood diſtending the ſmal Veins thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, redneſs of the Eyes, a flowing forth of tears, a pain, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is <hi>Blood,</hi> which either alone, or elſe caſtigated by other Humors, ſliding forth unto the part affected either by an afflux, or elſe by congeſtion is diſperſed thorow the Veins, and ſo diſtendeth them.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>Difficult,</hi> if it ariſe in cold Regions, and in a cold time, becauſe then the Members are more than at other times ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and confined; if it infeſt and annoy little Children, becauſe that it continually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a tender and weak Head; if the pain preſevere and long abide, becauſe it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a matter either corroding, or vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtending, or ſuppurating; if it be by conſent from the Membranes of the Brain, and the parts contained within the Skin; if there appear in the Eye ſmal grains of filth, becauſe theſe ſignifie a ſlowneſs of Maturation. It is <hi>more eaſie,</hi> if it be by Conſent from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; if the tears be more abundant, and more ſmarting, becauſe it cometh the ſooner to an end; if the belly be quick, in regard that the looſneſs of the belly freeth the party from it. It is to be <hi>accompliſhed,</hi> according to the Method of other Inflamations. It <hi>is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this,</hi> that ſomtimes by Veneſection the greateſt <hi>Opthalmies</hi> are wholly taken away within the ſpace of an hour. 2. That Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories applied behind the Ears do very wel draw back. For this purpoſe there is much commended by Hartman the meat of the Herb Rocket in a quilted bag. 3. <hi>Errhines,</hi> (and thoſe not overſtrong and violent) are to be adminiſtred, if the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath bin wont to evacuate the excrements of the head by the Noſtrils. 4. Topicks are to be applied, (but yet not until the end of three whole days) and theſe are to be actually ſome that warme, without any the leaſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity or Carroding quality, wel cleanſed and purified, and corrected by ſuch repellers as are in their own propriety helpeful; neither muſt they be too cool, nor too aſtringent, neither over dry; and thoſe may preſently be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56003:119"/>the forehead, and the neck; and they are to be followed with Anodynes, which (if there be any fear of a greater afflux) are very fitly applied to the eye, from the very beginning. 2. the womens milk is every hour to be changed, leſt that after long continuance it contract a certain kind of acrimony from the heat of the eye. 3. Opium and opiate medicaments are by no means to be admini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tred without great and urgent neceſſity. 4. Great caution muſt be had, leſt that there ſhould be any ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the inward parts. 5. In the diet, wine and the uſe of baths (in the declination of the diſeaſe) may very wel and without danger be allowed and permitted unto the ſick perſon. A Cataplaſme of the <hi>Crumbs of wheat bread and a roſted apple, with the breſt-milk of a woman, together with a little ſaffron and ſugar of ſaturn,</hi> is exceedingly commended. And ſo likewiſe is the water that is made of the <hi>juicy ſubſtance of Craw-fiſh diſtilled, two pints thereof, of Roſe water one pint, and Crocus metalorum half an ounce, infuſed altogether:</hi> as alſo <hi>of the waters of the eyebright, and Fennel, of each alike five ounces, with metalorum one dram; unto which</hi> there may be added <hi>a fit proportion of roſewater.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the diſcuſſives, <hi>Sarcocol</hi> wel waſhed, and the <hi>true Tutty of the Arabians,</hi> (which drieth without any kind of biting) obtain their place and uſe.</p>

                     <p>The CAUSE is whatſoever may open the veins, whether it be External or internal; as ſhal be further ſhewn in the differences.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>Eaſie,</hi> in the beginning, <hi>It is performed</hi> (Univerſal or general remedies having gon before) if the afflux be greater than is uſual, <hi>by diſcuſſives,</hi> at firſt ſuch as are more gentle, and corrected by aſtringents; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, thoſe that are ſtronger and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and yet withal ſuch as are void of acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and tartneſs, leſt that there ſhould more of the blood be enticed and drawn forth unto the part affected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is Divided</hi> three manner of waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is from <hi>Cauſes External,</hi> a blow, clamour, and ſounding of trumpets; in which we muſt preſently have recourſe unto <hi>Topical</hi> remedies, to wit, the decoction of the flowers <hi>of Melilote,</hi> and of <hi>Roſes, Fenugreek ſeed;</hi> Colliry compoſed of the <hi>blood of Pigeons, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their wings, two drams thereof; the breaſt milk of a temperate Woman half an ounce, and frankincence one ſcruple.</hi> Another is from <hi>internal Cauſes,</hi> to wit <hi>either great ſtore of blood,</hi> (where Veneſection muſt by no means be ommitted) or elſe from the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>great heat thereof;</hi> and then the ſpot or blemiſh tendeth unto a Citrine colour. We muſt withſtand and oppoſe the inflamation by the <hi>white of an Egg wel ſhaken together:</hi> if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56003:120"/>there preſent any Pus or filthy purulent matter the ſame is to be leſſened by a Collyry compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the <hi>Muciluge of fenngreek, with fennel water and honey of Roſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is <hi>Recent</hi> and new beginning; in which the blemiſh is of a red colour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Topical rememdies above mentioned, <hi>the tops of hiſſop</hi> boy led in ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water, tyed up in a little bage, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, is of ſingular uſe and bennifit in diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the peccant matter. Another is <hi>inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> and of long ſtanding; in the which the ſpot or blemiſh is black and blew. And for this we uſually preſcribe (as moſt proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) a Colliry compoſed of <hi>the Juyce of the greater Selandine and Carduus Benidictus, of each halfe an ounce; of the fat of the bird they cal Quoeſtula</hi> (or Queiſt) <hi>liquified and diſſolved, two drams, and of mirrh half a ſcruple;</hi> as alſo <hi>the Root of ſigillum Solomonis</hi> or Solomons Seal, well ſhaken together, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Another is, <hi>When blood is caſt forth either into the Adnata</hi> or the <hi>Cornea</hi> Tunicle.

                     <hi>THe Hemorrhage is an immoderate excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (and in the whole kind thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and above the courſe of nature) of the blood by the veins of the noſe, the ſaid veins being divided, rarefied, or opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing we are now treating of is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of that homorrhage that is <hi>Symptom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atical,</hi> (and not of that which is meerly <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>) which is cauſed in Feavers by the ſtrength and vigor of nature, with ſigns foregoing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,

                  <p>The CURE is <hi>difficult</hi> if it be ſo immoder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and immeaſurable, that in cholerick bodies (the Choller inflaming and burning the blood) the face becometh of a Citron or oringe color; in Flegmatik bodies, (the flegm being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; of a leaden color) and in melancholly bodyes, of a black and duskiſh color; and if it flow forth to the quantity of four pints therof; if it befal ſuch as are Phlegmatick and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, in regard that they are more cold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, than are the ſanguine or Chollerick; if it affect thoſe that are of an high and red color with a certain kind of pain in the head; if it doth not terminate and put an end to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe wherein it happeneth, and that a chilneſs and ſtifneſs follow thereupon; becauſe that the body being exhauſted of ſpirits, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cooled and chilled, and by this means breedeth diſeaſes that laſt and continue a long while.

               <p>THe Principal Affects of the <hi>Weſand,</hi> are, <hi>Laxation,</hi> and <hi>Inflamation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Laxation is, when it (to wit, the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand) preternaturally ſwelling up (yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Inflamation) for the moſt part from a Flegmatick Humor tranſmitted from the brain, is extended into an extraordinary length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is then called <hi>Cionis Chalaſmene;</hi> but it is termed <hi>Staphule,</hi> or the Grape, when in its lower part Waxing thick and growing round, it becometh more ſlender than that above which it hangeth; ſo that it beareth the reſemblance of a grape hanging by its little foot. But then (to tel you the truth) it lyeth upon the Root of the Tongue, and the Jaws, with a kind of troubleſom Titillation or tickling; with which whoſever is affected, he is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſtriving and endeavoring (but al in Vain) to devour it; fearing leſt that by the impetuous violence thereof he ſhould be ſtrangled. The <hi>Columella</hi> it ſelf becometh ſoft, ſomwhat whitiſh, and of the ſame color with the Palate, without pain and heat. The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is ſent down from the brain; and this eſpecially cometh to paſs in Catarrhes. This Affect <hi>is Cured</hi> like as the Inflamation. If the Columella be Eaten through, the ſharp Humor is to be tempered and qualifyed; and after this <hi>Abſterſion</hi> or Cleanſing muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. That which is here of ſingular benefit, is, a <hi>new laid Egg</hi> Eoyled unto a hardneſs, cut through the midſt, and for ſome hours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Crown of the Head; in Infants, <hi>a clean Paper</hi> four double, wel wet in the Mothers Milk and Roſe water (as much of one as of the other) applied and laid upon the Crown of the Head; a Powder compounded of Long Pepper one ſcruple, the <hi>Juyce of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacia,</hi> and <hi>Tormentil Roots,</hi> of each two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſo blown in after the uſe of an Aſtringent Gargariſm.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Inflamation of the Weſand,</hi> is, the riſing or ſwelling of the ſame, from a Choler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Blood fallen down into it, with a redneſs, burning heat, pain, danger of ſuffocation, and ſomtimes alſo with a Feaver. The buſineſs is here alike as in other Inflamations.</p>

               <p>The Diſeaſe of the <hi>Jaws</hi> is that we cal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> (or the <hi>Squinancy, but more vulgarly the</hi> Quinſey) <hi>or the ſhutting up (as it were) of the</hi> Jaws, <hi>that is, of the Supream parts of the Gullet and the throat, through which is an entrance and Paſſage not only for the meat and drink, but likewiſe for the Breath; Producing and Bringing along with it a Difficulty both of breathing and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. One is <hi>from an Inflamation, which is knowen</hi> by the continual fever accompanying, if withal there be together preſent ſuch other things as uſually concur. <hi>It hath its original</hi> from that blood that floweth into thoſe parts from out of the branches of the Jugular veins; there going before, for the moſt part, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficult moveing of the neck, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cauſes, and withal a certain pain; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an unuſual heat about the Jaws. It is <hi>very hardly cured,</hi> if there be preſent a great and Intence feaver the ſpittle ſomwhat dry, Clammy and thick. The <hi>Event</hi> of the Cure is ſomewhat <hi>doubtful,</hi> if (the matter being tranſmitted into the Lunges) there ariſe an Empema or impoſtamation of the Lungs to the Head, if it exciteth and cauſeth a doting, or delire: if to the <hi>Pleara</hi> Membrane, it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a pain of the whol Breaſt, with a cough, and difficulty of breathing: if unto the heart, it then introduceth and brings along with it a kind of trembling, and almoſt undiſcernable beating of the pulſes. There is no hopes at al if the fever prevail the greateſt heighth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſenes; if the face of the ſick perſon become greeniſh, if the angles or corners of the Eyes ſomewhat black and thick; and laſtly, if there appear froth about the Mouth, in regard that it ſignifieth an exteam ſtreightning of the heart.

                     <item>1. If it be doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide thereof be the more afflicted, (ſince that the Liver is the part tranſmitting) the blood ought then to be drawn forth of the right arm.</item>
                     <item>2. Where there is not ſo great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of brathing, the blood may be drawn forth the more freely and plentifully, but when the difficulty of breathing is great, there ought to be the leſs blood taken away, and that at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and the intervall of four or five hours betwixt.</item>
                     <item>3. That if Cuppinglaſſes be forthwith applyed unto that part that is nigheſt unto the place affected, then there wil be excited in that ſayd part the Greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux; and therefore they ought to be put upon the Reines, and not upon either the Arm or Neck.</item>
                  </list> 
                  <hi>Purgation</hi> is forthwith in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to be ordayned. <hi>Repellers</hi> ought inwardly to be adminiſtred unto the Jaws; and this eſpecially indeed in the form of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſmes, Mouth-waſhings (termed Collusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) and Luctures. And here there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>Lapis prunella,</hi> The Compoſition, of Mulberries, <hi>Muſt</hi> (or new Wine) and <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels;</hi> (in regard that it hath in it an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſtringent quality and power;) thoſe Medicaments that are formed of <hi>Sengreen, Plantane,</hi> and <hi>Purſlane,</hi> &amp;c. On the third or fourth day <hi>Digeſtives</hi> are to be mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Repellers. In the Declination of the Diſeaſe, the <hi>Aſhes of burnt Creviſes</hi> or Crabs is to be wel mingled with Honey; or the <hi>White Excrements of a Dog,</hi> or that of a <hi>Hen,</hi> or that that is taken out of the <hi>Swallows Neſt,</hi> poudered, and ſierſed.

The pain is felt, if the part affected be but externally touched: the Tongue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth forth from its proper place. The <hi>Cure</hi> is to be ſought for in its own due place, that is to ſay, from its ſourſes, ſpring, and Fountain.</p>
               <p n="3">III. One is from a <hi>Pituitous</hi> or Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>defluxion</hi> reſiding upon the Joynts and the Muſcles of the Neck; and then the pain is not great and violent, but dul and heavy; the ſwelling is ſomewhat broader, but then it hath in it very little or no redneſs; there is preſent no fever, or if any, it is but moderate. The voice waxeth hoarſe, there is great ſtore of ſpittle, the ſick Perſons alwaies gape with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth and drawing Air, there is likewiſe ſome difficulty in ſwallowing, but yet without any great hazard of ſuffocation. The <hi>Cure</hi> is to be ordered according to that of a Catarrh.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That which ariſeth <hi>from an inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> one is called <hi>Cynauche,</hi> which lyeth hid in the internal Muſcles of the Larynx or the Throat; and then whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the Jaws, or outwardly in the Neck, appeareth there any redneſs or ſwelling at al; but the Jaws are ſo vehemently pained, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with great danger and peril of ſuffocation, that the diſeaſed perſons are enforced to take in the Air and to breath with their neck erected ſtrait and upright, and with open mouth. The fever that accompanyeth it is moſt acute; and the diſeaſe ſtrangleth the party, within four days at the utmoſt, but very uſually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eighteen hours time. That which in this caſe much profiteth is <hi>Cupping glaſſes</hi> applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veins under the tongue: touching which ſee further in <hi>Zacutus Lufitanus</hi> in his eigth book. Chap. 2.</p>
               <p>Another is that we cal <hi>Paracynauche,</hi> which ſticketh and hath its reſidence in the external Muſcles: and then there is to be found within a certain ſwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Another <hi>Synanche,</hi> which is conteined in the interior ſpace or Cavity of the Jaws; and then, it likewiſe extendeth it ſelf unto the Root of the Tongue, and comprehendeth the Neck it ſelf; there is then alſo apparently to be diſcerned a ſwelling and a redneſs (in the outward parts) together with pain and heat; the which ſaid ſwelling if it have recourſe unto the more internal parts without any manifeſt cauſe, it then ſuddenly vaniſheth away upon thi tranſlation of the matter: the Symptomes ares here never a whit more milde and gentle than in the other ſorts, but yet notwithſtanding there is here greater hopes of ſafety, in regard that the Inflamation advancing into the outward parts, may poſſibly be drawn forth, and digeſted.</p>
               <p>Another is that we cal <hi>Paracynanche,</hi> the which ſeizeth upon the Neck alone, and the Muſcles thereof, that appertain unto the Tongue and the <hi>Hyoid</hi> bone.

                  <p n="1">I. Strumae (<hi>commonly called</hi> Scrofulae, <hi>or the Kings Evil</hi>) <hi>in the Throat are ſwellings in the Glandules or Kernels, generated of thick and Clammy Flegm, and included in their own proper Membrane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no need here of many SIGNS; the ſwellings are round, Pendulous and hanging, eaſily moved if touched, and ſuch as are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Skin.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is flegm, which is ſomtime alone, but other while conjoyned with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, it ariſeth from Meats that afford a Crude, raw, and thick Juyce, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is moſt Familiar unto Infants, and ſuch as are yet in the ſtate of Childhood. It may eſpecially likewiſe be thruſt and made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by thoſe Waters that contein in them Mercury or Quick Silver, ſuch as are thoſe in <hi>Carinthia, Styria,</hi> and about the <hi>Alpes.</hi> It is ſomtimes (together with a nouriſhing Juyce, if the ſaid Juyce offending in quantity be not wholly conſumed and waſted) by Nature ſent unto the Glandules as unto the more ignoble parts. The Membrane in which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded is never by the Formative Faculty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Vain, or to the end it ſhould be idle and of no uſe. For when as the Memberane is diſtended by the Superfluous Humor in great abundance thereunto flowing, and haply like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thereby broken, Nature then attempteth as it were the contexture and forming of a new kind of Membrane.</p>
                  <p>The CURE dependeth cheifly upon the Particulars following.

                        <item>1. That in reſpect of the ſituation of the part it is not to be removed without much difficulty; yet notwithſtanding that it ought to be evacuated.</item>
                        <item>2. That if there be there a greater ſtore than ordinary of flegm, it is then more fitly to be removed with thoſe Remedies that expectorate and mollifie (ſuch as are Eryngo Roots; and marſhmallow roots, common mallows, and Rayſins) than by thoſe medicaments that cut.</item>
                        <item>3. That many hot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are not here convenient, leſt that the thinner parts being waſted, the thicker remain behinde. The beſt remedy in this caſe is <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed.</hi>

                        <item>4. That if there be preſent an acute fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver together with the matter; we ought then to abſtain from thoſe medicaments we cal <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clegmata;</hi> for theſe by their dryneſs and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs do much if not wholly ſupreſs expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; from whence there followeth a more frequent reſpiration, or thicker fetching of the breath; and the matter alſo by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary heat becometh the more contumationus and obſtinate.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Diſtemper of the lungs <hi>is divided</hi> after a twofold manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One is <hi>without matter,</hi> which indeed hath in it no danger at al of ſuffocation, and is alſo more eaſily cured: Another <hi>with matter,</hi> which is to be Evacuatted and drawn back, like as we ſhewn above.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. One is <hi>hot, which is known</hi> by this, that the Cheeks by reaſon of the ſumes aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding become red; and that there is evermore a dryneſs of the tongue (together with a thirſt) which can no way be qualified but by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and drawing in of the cold Air; infeſting the ſick perſon; and likewiſe that the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more than uſually frequent and ſwift. In the <hi>Cure</hi> Cooling medicaments (which through the rough artery are thither to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed) ought to be adminiſtred; <hi>where note,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That thoſe medicaments that are mainly cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repelling are altogether enemies and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to the Breaſt, by intercepting the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the blood and ſpirit, and by their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and impayring the very nature of the Breaſt, ſince that it is Cartilaginous and bony</item>
                        <item>2. That among the principal internal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we are to account both the white and black <hi>Poppy, Rheas, Violets, Endive, Barly, Water-Lilies</hi> and their ſyrups.</item>
                        <item>3. That the diet ought to be conformable; and that for a drink and potion, the <hi>water of barly with the Syrup of Violets</hi> is excellent good.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Another is <hi>Cold, which is known</hi> by this, that Cooling Cauſes went before; that the Breathing is but weak, ſlow, rare, and the Pulſe like thereunto; and that the Breath that cometh forth is colder then ordinary. In the <hi>Cure</hi> we are to Uſe medicaments that heat; among which theſe are to be accounted of as very fit and proper, to wit, <hi>ſaffron,</hi> which is as it were the very life and ſoul of the Lungs, the Extract of <hi>calamus Aromaticus, old trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Coltsfoot, Nicotiana</hi> or tobako, <hi>ſcabious, the root of the Flower-de-luce,</hi> and the root of <hi>Aron</hi> or Cuckowpint, prepared; <hi>Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis,</hi> that <hi>Mixture</hi> they term <hi>Simplex oxymel Scillitick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. One is <hi>Moiſt; which is known</hi> by this, that the voice is hoarſe, the breathing thick and frequent, with a kind of wheezing, ſnorting, and much ſpittle. In the <hi>Curing</hi> hereof we ought carefully to avoid thoſe medicaments that are overdrying and aſtringent. The Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical oyl of <hi>ſulpher,</hi> and the <hi>flowers of ſulphur</hi> or brimſtone, (the ſhops cal this latter <hi>flores ſulphuris</hi>) in a rere egge that may be ſupped up; the wine wherein the <hi>eyes of crabs</hi> or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes have been mucerated, <hi>ſaſſafras, China root,</hi> &amp;c. are here of ſingular uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>

                  <p>The CAUSE is blood, which is poured forth of the right angle or comor of the Heart into that vein that we cal <hi>Arterioſa,</hi> and ſo filleth not only the veins and Arteries of the lungs, but likewiſe alſo the whol body. It is rayſed and ſtirred up from external cauſes, as a cold Air, and eſpecially the cold northern Air immediatly following upon the ſoutherly; the drinking of generous and ſtrong wines; a violent and more vehement motion, after long reſt and quietneſs, and this upon a ful ſtomach, the body being likewiſe ful and wanting Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation; Anger, and other the paſſions of the mind, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>ſome hopes</hi> of a CURE if the Spitle being of a mingled red and yellowiſh color give out and intimate any ſign of concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Lungs affected; and if the impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations be thruſt forth either unto the Ears, or unto the inferior ſeats of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> and ſo they either paſs and turn into a fiſtula (and ſo may be evacuated) or elſe they are derived unto the Thighs. It is ſomthing <hi>doubtful,</hi> if there be want of ſpittle, by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy or unpliablneſs of the matter, and the imbicility of the natural powers; if there iſſue forth and appear with much and thick urine, thoſe ſweats that at firſt did ariſe about the neck and the head; becauſe thoſe aforeſaid ſweats are thought to preceed from a forcible conſtraint, ſuffocation, and violence. As for al other things in the cure, if foloweth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of other inflamations. If it ſucceed <hi>any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therdiſeaſe,</hi> and the blood be already evacuated, then Cupping-Glaſſes with ſcarification ought to be applyed unto the Arms and the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Cheſt: let the Expectorations be of the ſtronger ſort, and ſo likewiſe the Topical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>difference</hi> is taken from the ſubject and the cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One is of the whole lungs, which if together with the heart it be inflamed, to that it proceed &amp; exceed it ſelf unto the ſide, it then produceth in the ſick perſon a reſolution or palſie. For the blood flowing abundantly into the great Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that the intercoſtal Arteries are thereby filled; and ſo that alſo thoſe little branches that penetrate throw the holes of the vertebra, of the <hi>Thorax</hi> into the ſpinal marrow, do ſwel, the Nerves there paſſing ſorth from the ſpinal are compreſſed, and being thus preſſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they cauſe a reſolution, and Palſy.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56003:139"/>then it reacheth unto the diaphragm. The vein on that ſide wherein the inflamation is, ought to be opened.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. One is from <hi>pure blood,</hi> from whence there ariſeth a Phlegmone. <hi>It is known</hi> by this, that there is produced a bloody ſpittle, unleſs haply the diſeaſe be extremely Crude; a ſtreightneſs of the pracoerdia and of the whol Breaſt oppreſſeth the party; an extraordinary great &amp; intence heavineſs contracteth the ſtern (to wit, that part of the Breaſt where the ribbs meet) and the Back; the Patient is not much afflicted with any acute Fever. But now that blood, <hi>ſometimes</hi> in the <hi>Angina</hi> or quinſy, breaketh forth violently out of the Jaws; and then they die within ſeven daies; if they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape theſe, then they become purulent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in thoſe that are in the midſt betwixt old age and the vigorous flouriſhing eſtate of thoſe of ful and perfect growth, the expulſive faculty, is more Languid and weak than in yonger perſons, they are therefore not to be cured but with much difficultty. <hi>Sometimes</hi> it is derived thither from the Pleuriſy, and yet not by the veſſells, becauſe that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayence for them; but by the membrane that inveſteth al the parts of the Thorax; and then in this caſe likewiſe, in regard there is a tranſlation of the matter from the outward parts unto the inward, that is to ſay, from the leſs noble unto the more noble parts, and ſuch as are nigher unto the Heart, the Malady is therefore the more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Another from <hi>Chollerick</hi> blood; from whence it is that the Quinſey is frequently turned into the Peripneumonia; and the Luugs being of a ſpungy ſubſtance doth eaſily admit of a Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and the thinner ſort of matter, and drink eth it in more deep than other. <hi>It is known</hi> by this, that the cough rayſeth a yellow ſpittle and that that is not mingled with much blood; the ſtreightneſs of the Cheſt, and the ſence of weight and the veins is leſs than in the former differences; and laſtly, <hi>it is known</hi> by this, that the patient in his fever is even ſcorched with a more ehement and intence burning heat.</p>

                  <p>The differences are taken from the Cauſes and the parts affected.</p>
                  <p n="1">I.

                  <p>Another is of the <hi>ſmooth Arteries, which is known</hi> from the breathing, which is with much difficulty: yet not only in the beginning, but likewiſe in the increaſe thereof; from the pulſe, being altogether various, unequal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting, great, ſwift, ſlow, rare frequent, vehement, by reaſon of the Combare betwixt nature and the Morbifique cauſe, ſhe being not able to expell the fuliginous or ſooty fumes, by reaſon of the ſtreightneſs and narrowneſs of the Arteries; from the palpitation or beathing of the heart (it being now very much oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and from fainting and ſwooning.

Touching the <hi>Cure,</hi> we ſhal ſpeak more anon.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. One is (underſtand this of the <hi>Rough Arteries</hi>) from an <hi>obſtruction</hi> by blood, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor &amp;c. Touching which more below.

                  <p n="3">III.

                  <p>Another from a <hi>Humor,</hi> and eſpecially that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56003:140"/>that is Phlegmatick, which is <hi>plentifull</hi> and abounding, and then (if by diſtilling it flow forth only into the Membrane that ſurroundeth and grindeth in the throat) it obſcureth the voice, and cauſeth a hoarſneſs: if this humor fal into the hollow, &amp; the channel of the throat it produceth a little ſheeps cough (as we cal it) with a certain ſence and feeling of an acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that continually provoketh to Coughing, or elſe the ſayd humor is <hi>thick and viſcid</hi> or cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but this is very rarely generated in the Lungs in regard that they are nouriſhed by a thin and pure blood; it almoſt alwaies ariſeth from Catarrhs falling down from the head; the which in tract of time by the force of the heat is changed into a Glaſſy, or Plaſterlike Phlegm which being by the many diſtillations returning in a round (as it were) and circuit ſtored up in great abundance, cauſeth the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thma.</hi> The ſame likewiſe exceedingly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the Patient with a kind of dry Cough, by the which there is hardly any thing expelled and brought away; it rendereth the breathing difficult; and cauſeth in the taking in and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the breath a ſnorting or wheezing, as we term it, in regard that it is impacted, and pertinaciouſly ſtuffed into the Lappets of the Lungs; it hath ſigns and tokens foregoing of a diſtillation either from the head, brain, or from the neighboring parts.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another is from the <hi>Pus,</hi> or purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is powred forth out of ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume; and then expectorating Remedies have their place.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PHthiſis is an Exulceration of the Lungs, from a ſharp corroding matter, with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fever, a Ccough, and a ſpittle that is both bloody and purulent; by the which the whol body is ſenſibly, and by little and little conſumed and extenuated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> of this exulceration is the Lungs together with the parts thereof, towit, the fleſhy ſubſtance, the lappets, the veſſells, and the Membranes; <hi>in thoſe</hi> eſpecially, that have their heads eaſily and ſoon filled, and where the head ſendeth many diſtillations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the organs of breathing; <hi>in thoſe,</hi> that from their very nativity have their Lungs of a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubſtance, that is, ſuch as is tender, ſoft, and eaſily waſted, as being moſt ſubject to corruption. And hence it is that ſuch as are deſcended of a tabid ſtock (that is to ſay, thoſe that iſſue from parents affected as beforeſayd) do all of them at the length (as it were by a right of inheritance) neceſſarily waſt away and conſume in the aforeſaid manner: <hi>in thoſe,</hi> that naturally have a ſtreightneſs and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Cheſt, and likwiſe a depreſſion of the ſame, a ſtreight neck or narrow throat, a lean and ſpare body, and their ſhoulder blades ſticking out behind them like as if they were wings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are, a <hi>Gentle</hi> and moderate Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceeding from vapors elevated and ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Lungs, and aſſaulting the heart by their ſudeen and violent irruption therunto with which there are alſo joyned other feavers that are otherwiſe ſometimes Erratick and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſometimes again invading the patient after the maner of a Tertian, whileſt that the humors within the veins by that heat as were kindled and ſet on fire corrupt and putrefy; and this (the truth is) being by its continuance and without any the leaſt intermiſſion, turned into the Hectick, immediately after meales, and in the night time, (like as do others) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth and groweth more prevalent. 2. <hi>A frequent Cough</hi> (like unto that of foxes) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great pain, which cheifly afflicteth and troubleth the party in the night time; and it hath its exiſtence from a matter that is ſharp, by reaſon of the irritation of the Lungs. 3. <hi>A bloody and purulent ſpittle:</hi> but this is not in al. Some there have been found, who after their retching, and the ſpitting up of a liquid and yellow humor, (being ſoon after ſeazed upon by a light and gentle fever have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon begun to fal away and waſt; and after ſom time, have caſt forth by retching a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſmal quantity of blood, together with a kind of <hi>Pus</hi> or corrupt matter: and many have been by ſenſible degrees taken away in whom (throughout the whol courſe of their lives) there appeared nothing at al of this bloody and purulent ſpittle. But I muſt tel you, that this <hi>Phthiſis</hi> is incident unto thoſe that are young, rather than unto aged perſons, in regard that young perſons moſt commonly abound with blood, and conſequently are affected with the heat and acrimony thereof, with the laxity or looſneſs of the veſſels, and likewiſe the hardneſs of the ſame, and in regard likewiſe that theſe excerciſe themſelves in a more violent manner, and have little regard to their diet. This hath one thing ſingular as propperly and peculiarly belonging thereunto, towit, that it proceed from the very ſubſtance of the Lungs, it is then frothy, and if it be put into the fire it ſtinketh, and is very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſcent. 4. The <hi>extenuation</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> which is from the aforeſaid continual, but gentle fever, the which by its fiery heat (diſperſed throughout the whol body diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Arterial blood, the mingling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56003:141"/>together with that of the Veins is altogether neceſſary unto Nutrition) hindereth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Aliment in the whole body, and by its preternatural heat waſteth and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that which is Concocted and ſtored up.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is a ſharp corroding matter, fallen down thither; of which we ſhall ſpeak further in the differences.</p>

                  <p>THe Diſeaſes of the Thorax or Cheſt, are, the <hi>Inflamation</hi> of the <hi>Mediaſtine,</hi> the <hi>Swlling</hi> of the <hi>Diaphragme,</hi> the <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> the <hi>Empyema</hi> or Conſtipation, the <hi>Conſumption</hi> or waſting of the <hi>Back,</hi> and the <hi>Worms</hi> of the <hi>Back.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Inflamation of the <hi>Mediaſtin,</hi> (that disjoyneth the Lobes of the Lungs) <hi>is known</hi> by the continual Feaver, the frequent thick and ſwift breathing, an extream and intenſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Breaſt, a ſmal pain at the ſtern, unto which the Mediaſtine is tyed, and by the ſpitting and caſting forth of that that is at firſt red, and then afterward Yellow. But the matter that is thus caſt up (becauſe that it is gathered together betwixt a double Membrane, as it were, and is not eaſily Evacuated, unleſs the ſaid Membrane be eaten through) is not in any great abundance. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from the Blood, and chiefly the Cholerick. <hi>It is Cured</hi> after the manner of other Inflamations. Where take notice, that the Repreſſing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments ought indeed, to be cold, but no way aſtringent; and that in this Caſe the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Violets</hi> is cheifly approved of; which muſt be made blood warm (unleſs it be in the ſummer time) and the Breaſt therewith anoynted.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The <hi>Tumors</hi> or ſwellings of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm</hi> are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Some of them are <hi>Cold,</hi> which <hi>are known</hi> by the difficulty of Breathing, the ſtretching out of the hypochondria, &amp; yet no ſwelling appearing in them upon the touch, and no deliry or dotage

                  <p>Others are hot, which <hi>are known</hi> (in their <hi>firſt riſing</hi>) by a feaver that is both continual and accute, a pain, the breathing little, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the extenſion of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> a palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or panting neer unto the diaphragm, and ſomtimes a kind of leaping in that place: (in the <hi>Progreſs</hi>) by the doting that attendeth it, the unequal reſpiration or breathing, being ſometimes ſmal and ſometimes great; ſwift, and as ſoon again altogether as ſlow and rare. <hi>They ariſe,</hi> from a blood hot and cholerick.

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe Pleurifie is an inflamation of the Pleura Membrane, and the adjacent muſcles, ariſing from the influx (or flowing) of a hot humor, with a pricking pain of the ſide, a Cough difficult breathing, a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acute Feaver, a hard pulſe, unequal, and frequent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The SIGNS <hi>Pathognomick</hi> (as we cal them) are, an extream <hi>pricking pain,</hi> becauſe the aforeſaid membran (which we cal pleura) being of a moſt exquiſite ſence, is extended by a ſharp matter. A <hi>Puls that is hard,</hi> une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and bearing a kind of reſemblance with a Saw, in regard that the part that is inflamed is Nervous. A <hi>Cough,</hi> by reaſon of irritation and tranſudation, (to uſe the terms of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinors) which in the beginning is dry, but in the progreſs adjoined with and attended by a ſpittle that is bloody and purulent. A <hi>Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> frequent and but very weak and ſmal, in regard that the muſcles (by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pricking pain) cannot be ſufficiently dilated. An <hi>acut feaver,</hi> in regard that the inflamation is ſo neerly neighboring unto the Heart. And al theſe ſigns ought to conſpire and meet al together, and not to be preſent in a ſcattering manner, one after another.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is an extream hot matter; or blood, either pure, or impure which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth eſpecially out of the <hi>vena cava</hi> (or great hollow vein adjoyning to the heart by the Branch that is termed <hi>Azugos,</hi> into the little thin ſtems and ſprigs thereof; which being opened, broken or the pors therof dilated, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is promoted and furthered by various external Cauſes, and cheifly a ſudden chilling, and cooling, cold northern blaſt after the great and warm ſouth wind, over much and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent exerciſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>good hope of a</hi> CURE; if the ſpittle receive a mature and ſpeedy concoction, and be eaſily and fitly caſt forth; and if on the foruth day the ſick perſon ſpit forth that that is white, light, equal, and this by coughing three or four times be terminated on the ſeventh day, and if on the ſeventh, that then it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the leventh or foreteenth day at the furtheſt; if on the crittical day there happen a flux of blood out of the noſtrils, the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, or the womb, with ſigns of Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if (which is indeed very rare) there chance a <hi>Metaſtaſis</hi> or tranſlation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto the joynts and the members of leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

If the Spittle be yellow, ſincere, and mingled with much watteriſhneſs; if the ſaid ſpittle be Glutinous and Clammy, becauſe this clammy quality is contracted from a burning and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heat; if it be ful of a green <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Signs of one <hi>preſent</hi> are already expreſſed in the Definition. There is preſent now and then a Feaver, as alſo a certain ratling noiſe or Wheezing, in regard that ſomtimes the matter ſticketh faſt in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Rough Artery, which when it is expelled by the breath, there is the aforeſaid ſound and noyſe excited; and ſomtimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, in the ſmooth Arteries. The dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in of the Breath is here more difficult than the exſpiration or Putting it forth. For whenas in taking in the breath, neither the Lungs, by Reaſon of the ſtore of matter, nor the Thorax, by Reaſon of the imbecillity of its motion, can eaſily be moved; Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing, endeavoreth as it were by reſt and quietneſs to cheriſh and repair the weakned and dejected powers; but in Exſpiration or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth the Organs and inſtruments of that work fal down and ſo give way of their own accord.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is the Obſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as wel of the Rough Arteries as of the Smooth; of which we have ſpoken above; and from what cauſes it proceedeth we ſhal declare in that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>The CURE hath reſpect unto the Cauſes; and it is ſomthing <hi>Difficult,</hi> if the ſick perſons be aged There is but <hi>ſmal Hopes,</hi> if the ſick perſon be thereby rendered Gibbous, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go ſtooping with the back bunching out; becauſe that in theſe the Lungs growing, and the <hi>Spina</hi> not growing nor increaſing, in the ſtreightneſs of the Breaſt the heat is ſtifled and ſmothered; if it be with an acute Feaver, in regard that the Cauſe of the Aſthma being dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Feaveriſh heat, is thereby rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made the more unfit and unable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and caſt forth that which offendeth upon the ceaſing of the Cough, the difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtil remaineth; if the ſtrength be much weakened, becauſe then they ſoon fal into the <hi>Syncope</hi> or ſwooning fits.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diffecences</hi> are taken, partly from Cauſes obſtructing and compreſſing, and partly from the acceſſions, and other the like Cauſes.</p>

                     <hi>THe Cough is a vehement, thick, and loud Efflation or Blowing forth of great ſtore of breath (together and at once) that was firſt attracted and drawn in by the Lungs, Cauſed by the ſwift Contraction of the Lungs and the Thorax, that ſo what ever is burthenſom and Grievous unto the Organs of breathing, may be expelled and ſhaken forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Symptom ſo evident, there need no SIGNS at al.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is, whatever may affect the Lungs, the <hi>Rough Artery,</hi> and that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane wherewith is is encompaſſed, and as it were ſwathed about within, whether this be ſomthing External, or elſe a Humor, or a Vapor, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The CURE either reſpecteth the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> from whence it ariſeth; or the <hi>Cough</hi> it ſelf, if it be vehement; which is either mitigated by Lenifiers or Anodynes or elſe is wholly taken away by thoſe Medicaments that ſtupefie and <hi>Dul</hi> the ſenſe and <hi>feeling,</hi> as for inſtance, the Syrup of Poppy, Diacodium, Treacle freſh and new, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of the Cough are Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One is from <hi>External Cauſes,</hi> as a Cold Air, the Vapors of Live things Rank, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56003:145"/>muſty, as likewiſe ſuch things as are Oyly and Fat; a vehement Scratching of the Ears, from whence there ariſeth a very painful affect of the Nervous parts; which yet is the leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if it proceed not from ſomthing fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Trachaea</hi> or the great rough Artery; and it is then alſo leſs dangerous. It is Cured, if the Cauſe be taken away; if it proceed from <hi>Cold,</hi> then it is Cured by the meer reſtraying and keeping in of the breath.</p>
                  <p>Another is from <hi>Cauſes internal,</hi> to wit.

Either is <hi>viſcous</hi> and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; (and then there is nothing or very little ſpit forth) after Coughing, if it hath conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it a cold temper and conſtitution, it is then the ſtronger and the more violent. It is cured (Univerſals firſt premized) by thoſe Medicaments that cut and expectorate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong purging Remedies, <hi>dilutum Agarici</hi> (as Practitioners term it) with a little <hi>oxymel Scillitick,</hi> is of ſingular uſe and benefit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe things that cut and expectorate, the <hi>Bechicall</hi> Aquavitae of Joel, the <hi>Liquor</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> of Hartman, the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> from ſix drops, to twelve.</item>

Or elſe ſuch as is <hi>thin;</hi> and then there is nothing ſpit forth, becauſe that in the very ſpitting of it forth, it is ſo diſperſed and divided by the breath, that it falleth back upon the Lungs; it hath for the moſt part a hot temperament and conſtitution, and likewiſe a Catarrh Joyned with it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. The Matter putrifying inwardly, exciteth, either a Putrid fever, or an Hectick fever, or an Ulcer. It is cured (after that General and Univerſal remedies have been firſt made uſe of) by thoſe things that increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate or thicken, and lenify; ſuch as are, the ſyrup of Jujubes; the ſyrup of Poppy <hi>rhaeas,</hi> diatragacanth; fridg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe principal affects of the Heart are, a <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> a <hi>Palpitation,</hi> and a <hi>Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or Swooning.</p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> (eſpecially that which is hot) we have ſpoken already in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book. Concerning that which is moiſt, Cold, and dry, there is nothing ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that offereth it ſelf to conſideration, but what we may as wel make mention of in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Species</hi> and kinds thereof: and therefore we intend to treat only of thoſe two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Palpitation of the Heart is an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and (by its dilatation and contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſetling it ſelf) compoſed motion of the ſame, whileſt it either expelleth that which is burthenſome unto it, or elſe attracteth, that that is requiſite and profitable unto it, or elſe reſtoreth that that is Deficient and wanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It differeth from <hi>Trumor</hi> (or the Trembling of the Heart) in that this latter ſhifteth its place, but the former ſeateth and fixeth it ſelf in one place alone, whether it be greater or leſs; this of the Moving faculty; that of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it may happen unto thoſe parts that are otherwiſe immovable.</p>
                  <p>The SIGNS are evident and manifeſt enough unto the very ſenſes, to wit, the ſight; the touch, and the Hearing. The Jugular Arteries are eſpecially thoſe that leap and Beat; and their pulſe is unequal and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is either any thing irritating the moving faculty, or elſe a neceſſily of refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration and cooling, by Reaſon of the hot diſtemper; or a Defect and want of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, touching al which ſpecially and particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly in the Diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>FAinting or Swooning is a ſudden and Precipitate fayling of al the Spirits, and eſpecially of the vital powers and ſtrength, with a pulſe much weakened, and almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſhed, as likewiſe with a cold ſweat, ariſing from an extraordinary great, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heart, through the fault and defect of the vital ſpirits; of which thoſe that remain retire alſo from the External parts of the Body unto the Centre, to wit, the Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the diverſity of the degrees of this ſad affect, ſo are the names thereof vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and different. <hi>Eccluſis</hi> is a ſmal and light fainting; <hi>Lepothimia</hi> and <hi>Leipopſychia</hi> is that which is ſomwhat more greivious; and <hi>Syncope</hi> is the moſt ſad and greivious of them al; which laſt, if it proceed ſo far, that the pulſe or beating is aboliſhed in the whole Body, it is then termed <hi>Aſphyxia;</hi> the reaſon whereof ſhal be declared in its definition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> (and that firſt of the affect not yet preſent, but very <hi>neer approaching</hi>) are, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in perſons unaccuſtomed thereto, an Anxiety that neither was nor indeed could be foreſeen, a <hi>vertigo</hi> or ſwimming in the head, a repreſentation, as it were, of ſtrange and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colors, an often reiterated change and alteration of the Pulſe. The Signs of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>preſent,</hi> are, a ſuden fal and failing of al the Powers of the Body, a Pulſe moſt weak and obſcure; and ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> &amp; the ſtrangling of the womb, the Chilneſs and Coldneſs of the whole Body, but more eſpecially of the extream parts, a cold ſweat, and therefore termed <hi>ſyncoptick,</hi> breaking forth, and chiefly in the temples, neck and Thorax; which if it be with an abolition of the Pulſe it is then to be accounted a ſign Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thognomick.</p>
                  <p>The CAUSE is a ſudden fayling of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits, whithout which neither the heart, nor indeed any other part of the body can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its actions; but as touching this we ſhal ſpeak more fully in the differences.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56003:147"/>
                  <p>There is <hi>ſome hope</hi> of a <hi>Cure,</hi> if it be only from the ſingle or ſimple diſtemper of the heart; if it proceed from evident and apparent Cauſes; and if it be by Conſent: There is no hope, if the patient fal often into theſe fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fits, and that without any manifeſt cauſe; if it befal a weak body; if the ſick perſon be not raiſed out of theſe fits after the ſprinkeling of Roſe water upon his face, and the drinking of wine; nor yet even after <hi>ſneezing wort</hi> hath been adminiſtred; if the heart primaryly lie and labor under this affect; and laſtly, if it affect thoſe that are Feveriſh and (by reafon of the great ſtore of humors) with an inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtomach and the Liver. The Cure hath reſpect. 1. Unto the paroxyſme; in the which the Spirits are to be refreſhed and cheered with the vinegar of the <hi>flowers of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> (a kind of Gilly-flowers) the vinegar of <hi>Rue,</hi> and of the <hi>Elder Tree;</hi> the balſam of <hi>white Ambor;</hi> and likewiſe by putting to the noſtrils wine, <hi>Roſewater, Cinnamon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and carbuncle water, &amp;c. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is hot, then cooling Medicaments; but if the Affect be Cold, then thoſe Remedies that heat and warm, are to be adminiſtred; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to women thoſe things that afford the moſt ſtrong and ſtinking ſavour. Unto the Region of the Heart Epithems, and inunctions of <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Mithridate,</hi> and the oyl of <hi>Citron,</hi> are to be applied. <hi>Wine that</hi> is old and <hi>odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous,</hi> is here moſt efficacious. II. It reſpecteth the <hi>intermiſſion;</hi> touching which more ſhal be ſayd, now we are come in the next place to ſpeak of the differences.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken from thoſe Cauſes that produce a defect of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One is, that <hi>Spirits are not generated,</hi> either by reaſon of a defect of Matter, to wit, the blood overmuch evacuated, and the Air corrupted; or elſe by reaſon of ſome defalt in the faculty, as wel in regard of the more noted and conſiderable diſeaſes of the Heart (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be from its diſtemper, or whether they be inſtrumental) as in regard of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Brain and the Liver, yea likewiſe of the ſtomach and the womb; and of al theſe there ought to be a ſpecial and due regard had in the cure.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another is from the <hi>Diſſipation</hi> of thoſe <hi>ſpirits that are generated</hi> and bred; which is cauſed.
<list>
                        <item>1. by thoſe <hi>inſenſible evacuations,</hi> that are either habitual, or elſe happen from the over great rarity and thinneſs of the skin: (and in this caſe we muſt have recourſe unto perfumes and ſweet ſmelling medicaments, and to thoſe kind of meats that afford a good and wholſom Juyce, the skin is to be conduſed and made thicker with the oyl of the mirtle tree, and with the oyl of Maſtick) or elſe it is from the thinneſs of thoſe things that are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and therefore here thoſe meats that are not over fluid, and eaſily diſſipated have their place, as being moſt fit and proper.</item>

                     <p>The <hi>Tumors</hi> of the Paps are four.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. An <hi>Inflamation,</hi> which is a hard ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>It is known</hi> by the redneſs, the pain, the pulſe or beating, and the heat thereof; by which it differeth from that we cal the Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Curdling of the Milk, and the overgreat abundance thereof. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from the great ſtore of Blood that is attracted, tranſmitted, or ſuppreſſed.

                        <list>
                           <item>1. By a Diet that is thin and ſpare, cooling and moiſtening.</item>

                           <item>3. By <hi>Evacuation,</hi> by opening the internal Vein of the ſame ſide, and ſo letting out the Blood; as alſo by a gentle Purgation.</item>
                           <item>4. By the Application of Topical Remedys, in the Inflamation of ſuch as thereunto accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</item>
                        </list>
And here we are <hi>to take Notice,</hi> that the Repellers ought to be temperate, leſt that the Heart be overmuch cooled; that in the <hi>Augmentation</hi> thereof there is commended beer and butter wel warmed, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; that the extream <hi>Hardneſs</hi> may moſt properly and ſuccesfully be prevented and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Medicament that is formed and made of the <hi>Marrow of a Calves Thigh,</hi> two ounces thereof, of <hi>Oeſipus</hi> or the moiſture of greaſie ſheeps Wool, one ounce; of <hi>Saffron four ſcruples;</hi> of <hi>Cummin</hi> wel <hi>bruiſed</hi> two ſcruples; that when it is <hi>Suppurated,</hi> (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Breaſts or Paps are Spungy and ful of hollow Caveties) it is moſt commonly to be opened in divers places thereof; that the <hi>Pap</hi> affected is very rarely cured and healed, unleſs the Milk of the other that is ſound be dryed up, in regard that the blood equally floweth unto both; and laſtly, that the <hi>Pain</hi> is to be moderated and mitigated; if it be in Summer, moſt fitly with the Leaves of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane;</hi> if it be in the Winter, then with the <hi>Roots</hi> of the ſaid Henbane, roaſted under the Embers, and then wel beaten together with Hogs Greaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Oedema,</hi> which is ſomtimes diffuſed and ſpread abroad throughout the whol Paps or Breaſts, ſo that they wholly and equally ſwel. <hi>It is known</hi> by this, that it is ſoft, and that by intervals, and at certain times (to wit, in the time that the Courſes flow) the ſwelling and the pain is exaſperated; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that there is evermore ſome of the ſwelling remayning. The <hi>Original</hi> and the <hi>Cure</hi> hereof are to be ſought for out of that which is ſpoken in the general touching theſe Tumors. And here it is only <hi>to be Obſerved,</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>Scirrhus</hi> of the Paps is either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, or <hi>not Exquiſite,</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The <hi>Exquiſite</hi> is various. I. One is that which is but <hi>newly</hi> begun, or but <hi>now beginning,</hi> which upon the touching thereof is a little painful; and in this regard it is diſtinguiſhed from a Cancer that is likewiſe but now beginning; and it is very hardly Cured. Another Old and <hi>Inveterate,</hi> which is hard, without pain, incurable by Medicaments, eſpecially if it reſemble the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Capers; or if haires grow therein; it is ſomtimes Cured by Manual operation. II. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>by the Congeſtion</hi> or heaping up of a Humor that is in it ſelf thick, in the Curing of which we are not to uſe Vinegar, either in the beginning, or long, at any time, leſt that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſidue thereof ſhould be hardened and become like unto a ſtone; or elſe that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the part being overdryed ſhould waſt and conſume away: neither ought we to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing by Manual operation, if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56003:148"/>whol Breaſts or Paps Wax hard, and that the ſwelling ſo add hereunto the Thorax or Cheſt, that without extream peril it may not be thence removed. Another <hi>by Reſolution,</hi> in which the thinner part is dryed up by prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Medicaments; and which <hi>Galen</hi> Cured by an Evaporation of the ſharpeſt and ſoureſt Vinegar, poured forth upon the <hi>Pyrites</hi> ſtone, (we cal it the fire ſtone) Red hot, but this was after the uſe of liquid and moyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Medicaments. In the <hi>Curing</hi> of them al, we muſt be ſure that we have a ſpecial regard unto the Spleen, and the ſuppreſſed Courſes, and that Emollients and Reſolvers ſucceed one the other, and be interchangably applied.</item>
                           <item>2. The Scirrhus <hi>not Exquiſite is known</hi> by this, that the ſwelling is bigger than in a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, of the color of Aſhes, with an hardneſs, and the Veins thereof ſomwhat black and blewiſh in the outward parts; and that it ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vexeth the Party, eſpecially upon the neer approching of the Menſtrua or Courſes. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from Black Choler mingled together with Melancholly, eſpecially in ſuch as are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or ſuch which ſoon ceaſed their Child-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or elſe, laſtly, thoſe that have altogether a ſuppreſſion of their Termes, or monthly Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In the Curing hereof, among the Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers without aſtriction, there is commended the Unguent <hi>of Frogs;</hi> of which ſee further in <hi>Caſtrenſis</hi> his firſt Book of the Diſeaſes of Women, Chapter, 21.

                     <p n="4">IV. A <hi>Windy Tumor,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that the pain is very acute, eſpecially in the left breaſt, with an Excruciating and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Arm, the whol ſide, the Ribs, and the Shoulder blades. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation that is thick and drawn up from the Menſtrua, or the Seed ſuppreſſed, or elſe from ſome other Excrements, and ſo extending the ſaid Paps. In the <hi>Cure</hi> hereof, take notice, that a Linnen Cloath ſoaked in <hi>Soapſuds;</hi> or elſe wet in Water, and then dryed, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for diſſipation, and when there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſperſe and Scatter; and that the Pain is wel mitigated with bread taken hot out of the Oven, and then moyſtened with the <hi>Oyl of Nard,</hi> the ſhops cal it <hi>Oleum Nardinum,</hi> and of <hi>Rue.</hi>

<list>

                     <p n="1">I. The <hi>Defect of Milk</hi> (according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Cauſes) is twofold.</p>

                        </gap> that over dry the body; from a diſtemper in the Liver, from much raſting and ſpareneſs of Diet; and laſtly, from extraordinary Evacuations; of al which there muſt be care taken in the Cure. Now to generate and breed Milk, theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are experimentally found to be good, Namely <hi>Cryſtal</hi> prepared, the leaves, Roots, and Seed, of <hi>Fennel,</hi> while they are freſh and green; the ponder of <hi>Earth-worms</hi> prepared, and taken in Wine, the <hi>Electuary</hi> of <hi>Zacuthus,</hi> in the Ninth Book of his Pract. Hiſt. and laſt Chapter.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>Redundance</hi> or over great ſtore of Milk proceedeth from the abundance of blood, and a ſtrong Lactifical Faculty. In the <hi>Cure,</hi> the Luxury and prodigality of Nature in the breeding of Milk is to be reſtrained; and the Milk that exceedeth and is over and above, ought to be diſſipated and dryed up. For this purpoſe veneſection in the firſt place, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of; and then driving back by Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ought to be put upon the Paps, towards the Arms; And alſo thoſe Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that waſt away and leſſen the Milk, ſuch as that they cal <hi>Muria</hi> (a kind of briniſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or Pickle) <hi>with the pouder of Cummin,</hi> and <hi>Hemlock</hi> Boyled in Chervil Water and Vinegar, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>Coagulation</hi> or Curdling of the Milk is then Cauſed, when the more thin and ſubtile parts do by little &amp; little exhale, &amp; the thicker remain behind; from whence the Glandules or Kernels wax hard, and ſwellings, yea and alſo impoſtumes ariſe. In this Caſe the Infant ought not to be ſuckled out of the Breaſts affected; and yet notwithſtanding the Milk is to be ſuckt out, leſt that which is bred anew ſhould be Curdled by that Milk that is already become (as it were) Cheeſe, and that part of the Curdled Milk that begins to be diſſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The CAUSE is the diſtemper of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and that oftentimes hot, which burns up, corrupts, and putrefies the meat; but every thing corrupted, according to its nature puts on a ſtrange quallity: hence it is, that things ſmel ſo diverſly.

                     <p>
                        <hi>An inflamation of the Guts is a ſwelling of them ariſing from blood out of its veſſels fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into them and putrefying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are a fixt and diſtending pain, the perceiving of a Tumor, that the Guts may be perceived to be rowled up like the ſtrings of an inſtrument, coſtiveneſs of body, a ſtoppage of the Urin, a Feaver preſent.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is explained in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Autum the blood chiefly flows thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon of its thinneſs, becauſe the thin and moveable Humors generated in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by the inequal cold of the Autum, are driven to the center of the body.</p>
                     <p>The CURE muſt be ordered according to the rule of other inflamations, and that quickly, becauſe the evil is acute, and oftentimes turnes to a gangrene, and mortification. The cooling Medicines, which are adminiſtred for it, ought to be without aſtriction; we muſt wholy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Purgers, leſt the place affected be exaſperated.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>divided</hi> according to the place and Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> of which we have now treated; another from <hi>the Navel Rupture,</hi> of which in its place. Another from <hi>the Rupture of the guts,</hi> in which the Guts ought preſently to be put back into their place. Another from <hi>a contuſion,</hi> in which, to thoſe things which are applyed for the inflamation muſt be added ſomwhat lenifying and concocting.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is in the <hi>ſmal guts,</hi> which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in which a diſtention of the ſtomach, ſtraitneſs of breathing, daily vomitings, do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, that they are not able to contain their drink, the pain and Torture tends moſt to the upward parts. Another in the <hi>great Guts,</hi> in which the pain reaches more to the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries, there is a heavineſs in the Loins, and vomiting is not ſo continual.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Straitneſs of the Guts is known</hi> cheifly by this, that the Excrements of the Belly are not rightly caſt forth by ſtoole.</p>
                     <p>It hath its <hi>Differences</hi> according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is from <hi>External things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent and drying,</hi> as quinces, and other things, which is known by the relation of the Patient and ſtanders by. In the Cure are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired things moiſtening and mollifying, fat things, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is from <hi>the Excrements har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dned,</hi> obſtructing them, which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that there is no Tumor, pain, yet the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not caſt forth. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> at that place eſpecially where the ſmal and great Guts end, either from too dry matter, and drink to much diluted, or from the heat of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts ſucking up the moiſture.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>Cured</hi> by Mollifiers, by <hi>a bath of ſweet Water</hi> with emollient Herbs, <hi>by the Greaſe of a</hi> roſted <hi>Gooſe</hi> caſt in by a Clyſter, by blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing up the Guts with a Pair of bellows, which muſt be followed with a ſtrong Clyſter with half a dram of Sal gema.</p>

                     <p n="4">IV. Another from the growing together of <hi>the Guts</hi> which is incurable.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Another from a Rupture or worms, of which ſhal be ſpoken hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Another from <hi>thick Flegm,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that Cauſes generating that went before; crudities, flowneſs of the belly to ſtoode, and much wind abound. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from the fault of the Dier, and the feeble heat

                     <p>The CAUSE is a viſcous and Flegmatick Humor which ariſeth from much eating, meats that eaſily corrupt, &amp; generate a thick juyce, as cheeſe, Milk, pulſe, decaying fruits, ſweet things, ſugard things, honyed things, &amp;c.

                        <hi>The Iliack paſſion is a ſharp pain in the ſmal Guts, ariſing from a violent ſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, with a Tumor of the belly rowled up like a bundle of ſtrings, and ſo great an obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Belly, that nothing goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the Humors and Excrements are ſomtimes violently caſt up by vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The part affected</hi> is the Ileon Gut, and the other ſmal Guts, for though ſomtimes the great Guts alſo may be affected; yet there is no ſuch vehemency and danger in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are looſer and more ignoble.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, a ſence of paine in the upper guts, rouled up above the navel, moſt ſharp, extending it ſelfe upwards cheifly to the right ſide, a puffing up and vehement diſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an eminent ſwelling of the upper part of the belly and ſmal guts, a perfect reſtraint of dung and winde, vaine belchings bringing no eaſe, murmurings of the ſmal guts, and cheifty of the upper; if the evil doe increaſe, al things are carried upwards. Hence follow vomitings, ſwellings under the ears, a coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts and whole body, with a great difficulty of breathing and ſtoppage of urine, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The conjunct cauſe is a violent ſolution of continuity, proceeding from obſtruction, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and other things (of which ſhal be treated in the differences) for then the expulſive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the guts, riſing up to expel that which is troubleſome to them, and whenas it cannot move its natural way downwards, becauſe the paſſages leading to the fundament are poſſeſt with a ſtrong obſtruction; or becauſe the part

                           <hi>Point, III.</hi> Of a Dyſentery.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A Dyſentery is a frequent, bloody, and Purulent going to ſtool, with a Pain in the Belly, and Exulceration of the Guts, from a ſharp corroding matter peculiarly offenſive to the Guts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Name</hi> of Dyſentery is attributed alſo to a diarrhy, in which the Humors which are voided do Cauſe torments, although there be no Exulceration: and with this if blood ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be voided, that comes rather from an opening of the Veſſels, than an Exulceration of the Guts.</p>
                        <p>The SIGNS are an often going to ſtool, becauſe the Guts are ſtimulated by the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Humor; ſomtimes continually if the matter be ſufficient, ſomtimes it returns periodically every third day. The pain and torments of the Belly are eſpecially at going to ſtool, and a little before the excretion. Thoſe things that are voided are, ſomtimes Choler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, and of divers kinds, ſomtimes mucous and bloody, ſomtimes wholly different from the natural kind of excrements. A Feaver ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the Diſeaſe hath laſted for ſome daies, by reaſon of reſtleſſneſs and putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. See the difference from <hi>an Hepatick flux</hi> in the Chapter of that; It differs <hi>from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumation,</hi> at whoſe breaking there follow eliquations as it were of matter, becauſe in that a beating pain doth precede neer the affected place, and there is neither biting nor looſeneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The CAUSES are ſharp Humors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding the Guts, and peculiarly offenſive to them, conteining I know not what Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Helleborine, or ſomwhat like unto the Sea Lungs, offenſive to the Lungs, and like to Cantharides inimicous to the bladder. Theſe infected by a Dyſenterical Contagion, peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into the Veins and arteries do cauſe a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and imprint a diſpoſition like unto it ſelf, by a ſtain on the whol maſs of blood, and ſtir it up with the other Humors as purgers do: they fix alſo an evil diſpoſition on the Guts, ſo that the chyle paſſing by is changed into a vitious Humor, and the Excrements of the Belly receive not a natural Elaboration and quality. Somtimes in human bodies they are rendred ſuch by the occult influences of the ſtars; hence ſucking children, who never came into the open aire, and were only nouriſht with their Mothers Milk, are ſomtimes taken with a Dyſentery. But <hi>they have their Original</hi> from <hi>Waters</hi> carried through Leaden and Old condites; from the ſpring <hi>Aire,</hi> rainy and ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly after a dry and northerly winter, both by reaſon that the drying up of the Humors is hindred, and by the ſtrong puttefying power in moiſture: from a hot and dry Aire, thence at the begining of the autum, and end of the Summer this Diſeaſe is raiſed, and Reigns cheifly in the hotteſt Countries. From evil and unaccuſtomary <hi>Meats,</hi> hence in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>India</hi> 'tis common becauſe they feed on the fleſh of beaſts which are nouriſht by <hi>Caſſia Fiſtula.</hi> From autum, <hi>Fruits,</hi> both becauſe they eaſily putrefie, and becauſe by their aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they retaine thoſe which are putrefied. The uſe of Grapes and new Wine, becauſe they make a Fermentation, and are eaſily tainted with foulneſs, Blaſting, dews.</p>
                        <p>The CURE is <hi>Difficult</hi> in women by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their tenderneſs and weakneſs; in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by reaſon their Guts are moiſter, and therefore ſubject to Putrefaction; in Old
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56003:162"/>people by reaſon of the greatneſs of the cauſe that is the acrimony of the humors in a body indiſpoſed, and Feebleneſs of ſtrength. <hi>'Tis doubtful</hi> if the ſtools be ſincere, that is, mixt with no wateriſh moiſture. If the effuſion of pure blood be joyned with it, for it ſhews that the greater veins are corroded. If loathing of meat afflict with a feaver, becauſe the ſtomach being drawn into conſent, the concoction is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, &amp; there is ſome ulcerous putrefaction in the guts. If cholerick vomitings ſeize at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, becauſe it argues a great power of boyling choler which troubles the upper and lower belly. If the ſtools be continual, or that ſtopping a new dilute flux, bloody like to an hepatick flux; or a filty diarrhy do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. If it invade with a feaver or with divers colored ſtools, or an inflamation of the liver. If it happen to a woman great with child, and bate not after the delivery of the child and voiding of the ſecundine. <hi>Of ſome hopes,</hi> if the excrements be changed, unleſs the change be to worſe, if belching or farting ſucceed becauſe it is a ſigne that nature doth begin to concoct. If it befal the ſplenitick, becauſe the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly humors are carried away, where we muſt wel diſtinguiſh between the melancholy blood concrete in the guts, and black choller. If it follow madneſs, becauſe it betokens that the matter is tranſlated from the head to the lower parts. <hi>Of little hopes,</hi> if black choller be voided of its own accord, no feaver going before, nor good concoction appearing, becauſe it differs nothing from an ulcerated cancer. If convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ravings Succeed, becauſe they ſhew the matter is carried to the head and nerves. If peices of fleſh be voided, becauſe the ſubſtance of the guts cannot be regenerated, nor a ſcarre be drawn over ſo great an exuleration. If any one releeved from an acute diſeaſe be taken with it, becauſe his ſtrength is not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe it. If in proceſs of the diſeaſe the hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kops follow, if a black puſtle like to a vetch appear behind the left ear with a great thirſt, becauſe it ſignifies death on the twentieth day.</p>

                        <p>Another <hi>is already made,</hi> when the corroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peirces deeper, and either fibres and ſmal skins of the inward coat are voided with blood, or peices of the fleſhy ſubſtance cut off from the proper ſubſtance of the guts are voided with membranous ſhavings and much blood and purulency, which is the utmoſt degree of malignity.</p>
                        <p n="2">II Another is <hi>of the ſmal guts,</hi> in which the pain is moſt acute by reaſon that they are membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; the ſtool is longer after the torments, the blood is exquiſitely mixt with the excrement by reaſon of the longer paſſage, the blood is blacker. Purging medicines muſt be given by the mouth: 'tis almoſt incurable.</p>
                        <p>Another <hi>of the great guts,</hi> in which the paine is leſs by reaſon of their fleſhineſs, tis cheifly perceived about the navel, by reaſon of their ſituation; the ſtools are quickly after the torments; the blood &amp; purulent matter ſwims upon the excrements of the belly. <hi>Note</hi> that for the moſt part the great guts are tainted, and being tainted medicines are beſt adminiſtred by gliſters. Somtimes the ſtomach and neighboring parts are drawn into conſent, ſomtimes the belly over againſt the ulcer and hole is perforated, by reaſon of the putrefaction communicated to it.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Another is <hi>from things external,</hi> viz. either from <hi>poyſons,</hi> whoſe cure is performed by vomits; by things that dul them whiles they teare, as milk, rice, fat broths; by antidotes, cheifly ſix grains of an <hi>emrald prepared;</hi> but they muſt abſtain ten hours from meat, and ſweat. Or by <hi>purging medicines</hi> that are very ſtrong, and then if you conſider the cure, after abſterſives 'tis good to drinke warme milke, new treacle, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>from things internal,</hi> of which hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="4">IIII.

The ſame may be mixt with purgers.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>ſimple,</hi> to which thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove may be applied.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. One is from <hi>Yellow choler,</hi> from which for the moſt part it begins, the which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is generated in the ſtomach, ſomtimes in the guts, ſometimes is caſt from the bladder of gall, the meſeraick veins, the whole body.</p>
                        <p>Another from <hi>Black choler,</hi> which if it be voided by reaſon of a criſis in feaveriſh diſeaſes it may be cured. It ought not to be purged before it be tempered, and then with Lenitives.</p>
                        <p>Another is from <hi>Choler of a leek color, and the ruſt of Braſs,</hi> which though by Nature col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it ſelf it may be caſt off, yet not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
                        <p>Another is from <hi>Salt Flegm,</hi> which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is produced in the head from a great heat, ſomtimes in the ſtomach; being carried to the Guts, and by its clammineſs ſticking long to them, it troubles them, and at length Exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.

                           <hi>Point, 4.</hi> Of the Bloody and Hepatick flux.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. <hi>The bloody Flux is known</hi> both by the ſight, and by this, that it is voided without pain and exulceration. It <hi>ariſeth.</hi> 1, <hi>By reaſon of plenty of Blood</hi> proceeding <hi>either</hi> from a hot diſtemper of the Liver, and then there wil be ſigns of fulneſs. 'Tis voided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain and waſting of the Body; the Urin is thin, of a Goldiſh color. Thirſt oppreſſeth both by reaſon of the waſting of the moiſt ſubſtance, and the heat of the Liver. <hi>In the Cure</hi> the diet muſt be abated, the Liver muſt be corrected by ſuccories and other proper coolers, ſteeled milk, &amp;c. If Choler be mixt with it, it muſt be emptyed. <hi>Or</hi> from the cutting off of ſome member, and then blood muſt be let according to Courſe. <hi>Or</hi> from the ſuppreſſion of ſome accuſt omary Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then we muſt act by frictions, the ſtoppage muſt be opened. 2. <hi>by reaſon of a vein broke or opened,</hi> which is known by this, that it is caſt up alſo by vomiting. Some vehement fal hath happened before. Fainting is Cauſed by reaſon of the putrefaction in the ſtomach. The cure is difficult.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>An Hepatick flux</hi> is either <hi>Exquiſite,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that that which is void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doth look thinly red, as the waſhing of the fleſh of a beaſt newly kild, doth not clod to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, doth flow more frequently, yet not ſo often as in a dyſentery; without any knawing, but yet not without a Heavy pain; the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids are ſwelled and the Feet, the excrements are crude. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from a weakneſs of the Liver, and the defect of natural heat in it, from cauſes that do diſſipate, or choak it up. <hi>The Cure</hi> muſt be haſtened becauſe this Diſeaſe Leads to an ill habit of Body, a dropſie, and Conſumption. <hi>'Tis hard</hi> when tis beginning, and in young men. <hi>Almoſt incurable</hi> when its inveterate and in old men, and in them alſo whoſe ſpittle is bloody, ſomwhat pale, or clearly cholerick. It excludes Purgers, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56003:164"/>is perfected only with altering &amp; ſtrengthning medicines mixt with the meats (Hens Livers Chickens and Geeſe ſtones, are commended.) Or <hi>Spurious,</hi> in which the blood is <hi>either</hi> acrid by the mixture of Choler, <hi>or</hi> thick by its long ſtay in the Liver, or elſewhere, <hi>or</hi> faeculent by reaſon of the foulneſs of the Liver becauſe the Spleen doth not attract the feculent parts.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Inflamation</hi> comes either from violent Cauſes, or from Medicines, and corroding cauteries. <hi>It is known</hi> by the ſharp Launcing pain, fixt in one and the ſame place, by a vain deſire of going to ſtool, in which by reaſon of the greatneſs of the Tumor obſtructing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or very little is voided. <hi>The cure is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi> both becauſe the part is endewed with an acute ſenſe, and becauſe the Excrements of the Belly hinder Applications, and becauſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the heat and moiſture of the place, the Diſeaſe degenerates into Ulcers.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Warts</hi> are either <hi>Condylomata,</hi> or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Skin of the Anus, viz.

                     <p n="1">I. One is of <hi>the internal,</hi> which ariſeth from a branch of the Spleen, extended through the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56003:165"/>Meſentery about the Colon and right Gut, in the Muſcles of the Anus and inward part of the Gut, having an Artery joyned with it, that alone is there terminated. <hi>It is known</hi> by a weight about the Fundament, difficulty of going to ſtool, by Clyſters, Suppoſitories, or an inſtrument. And alſo if a Cupping-Glaſs be applied, as <hi>Zacutus</hi> hath done.</p>
                     <p>Another is of <hi>the External,</hi> which proceed from the Epigaſtrical branch of the Vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, and are diſſeminated to the external parts of the right Gut, viz. The Muſcles of the Anus, but they are two, having an Artery joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them from the Hypogaſtrical Artery. Yet they ſeem al to have communion one with another. <hi>It is known</hi> by the ſight, and becauſe 'tis greater, 'tis alſo more dangerous. <hi>In the Cure</hi> external things have a convenient Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is by <hi>default of the blood,</hi> which either is <hi>too much,</hi> and then there are ſigns of fulneſs, we muſt revel by bleeding in the Arme, or if ſtrength wil not bear it, by fixing Cupping-Glaſſes to the Loyns or Hypochondries. Or <hi>ſharp and thin,</hi> and then it happens moſt to Southern people, eſpecially to men that are Sanguine. Serous Humors if ſtrength wil bear it, ought to be emptyed: if not, we muſt uſe coolers and things that thicken the blood; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, Purſlane, Trochiskes of burnt Ivory, and Amber do excel. Or <hi>it flows from the Liver,</hi> and then 'tis like to Water in which fleſh new kill'd is waſht. <hi>The Syrup of corals</hi> is good. Or from the <hi>upper Parts,</hi> and then the blood is black and burnt. Or from <hi>the Meſentery,</hi> and then 'tis little, ſomwhat white &amp; Serous. Or from <hi>the Guts,</hi> and then 'tis mixt with the Excrements.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>by default of the Veins,</hi> which either <hi>are opened,</hi> in which Cauſe we muſt uſe <hi>Agglutinatives,</hi> as the Muſhrum, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Wolfes Fart, &amp;c. Burning and cutting, the which are dangerous, eſpecially in thoſe that are inveterate and of long continuance. Or <hi>Eaten through and broke,</hi> and this Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Caſts a man into a Dropſie and other Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>The Suppreſſion of the Hemerhoids is an interception of the blood endeavouring to get forth through the Veins of the Anus, from whence they are raiſed up into a Tumor with pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are a tumor and bunchings out in the heads of the veins of the Anus, ſometimes hard &amp; like unto warts, ſomtimes ſoft caled like to mulberries, ſomtimes of a purple colour, and like to grape ſtones; the pricking paine, is ſomtimes milder, ſomtimes more greivous, the Veins being diſtended whoſe Mouths hangs as it were out of their heads, and the membrane which covers the orifices of the Veins, ſtretcht and preſt.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is Faeculent and thick blood deſiring to get forth.</p>

                     <hi>I. The diſtemper of the Meſentery</hi> for the moſt part is hot and dry, which ariſeth from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56003:166"/>the like matter, which either is collected there, of ſent thither from ſome other part. <hi>It is collected</hi> either in its <hi>veins and arteries,</hi> and then becauſe the breaſt hath the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the hemorrhoidal artery, becauſe the trunke from whence the artery ariſeth deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the heart, preſently at its firſt riſe, doth propagate the intercoſtal branches, there are continuall pains felt in the breaſt: or alſo <hi>in its glandules</hi> by their laxneſs eaſily drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the matter. <hi>The cure</hi> muſt not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, becauſe 'tis wont to fore-run a dry drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.

                  <p>
                     <hi>AN inflammation of the meſentery is a tumor of the ſame ariſing from humors poured forth with the nouriſhing blood into its ſpaces, or deeply impacted in its glandules, and putrefying by the acceſſion of external heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſigns</hi> are a ſlow feaver, for the moſt part a ſemitertian, a pain in the Loins, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on both ſides, ſometimes in the right, which extends it ſelf to the fore part of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above and about the Stomach; coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body, chylous ſtools, which for the moſt part a thin matter doth follow, ſomtimes ſincere and yellowiſh, ſometimes mixt with the excrements. <hi>It differs</hi> from the pains <hi>of the ſtomach, of the womb, Chollick and Stone,</hi> by the ſigns expreſſed in them. <hi>From the Fatneſs of the Belly,</hi> becauſe this may be al comprehended in the hand, becauſe it cleaves to the upper skin, and may be ſeparated from the muſcles of the belly. <hi>From a tumor of the muſcles of the belly,</hi> becauſe that where 'tis preſt cauſeth paine, and doth not ſo much bind the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cauſe</hi> is explained in the definition; the blood <hi>is poured forth</hi> thither, becauſe the way for it to the guts is ſtopt, either by aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things, which happens in a dyſentery ill cured, or by plenty of thick, clammy humors, ſuddainly ruſhing to the guts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cure</hi> muſt not be neglected, for 'tis dangerous both by reaſon of the feaver with which the patient waſts, and by reaſon of the putrefaction, by which the meſentery is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But 'tis extended ſomtimes to the fortieth day, ſomtimes to the eighty, ſomtimes it laſts al the life time, a feaver and collick paines ſomtimes returning, ſomtimes ceaſing. <hi>'Tis performed</hi> as in other inflamations, only note, that the coolers ought to be more benign
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56003:167"/>leaſt the matter be more impacted. <hi>The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> muſt be none or gentle, nor in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning leſt more be attracted, but when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation tends to concoction. Neither is <hi>Caſſia</hi> ſafe enough in the undertaking of the Cure.</p>
                  <p>As concerning <hi>the Differences,</hi> ſomtimes <hi>the Guts alſo are inflamed,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> al things are worſe. Somtimes <hi>the Inflamation ſticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the glandules,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> they are lighter. Somtimes <hi>the neighbouring Liver is drawn into conſent,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> a burning Feaver for the moſt part goes before, the evil afterwards tending to ſuppuration, a ſlow Feaver fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                  <p>The Signs <hi>of that to come</hi> are a Jaundice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſpicuous in the eyes, and every where about the temples, the appetite loſt, a heavineſs increaſing in the Hypochondries, ſeldome going to ſtool, ruddy Urin. Of <hi>that preſent,</hi> a ſtrong ſuppreſſion of Wind and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, a vehement Pain of the Belly and Loyns, a caſting up of Medicines by vomit, little ſucceſs of Clyſters, &amp;c.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Cure</hi> varies according to the nature of the differences.

A ſwift and unequal pulſe, by reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56003:169"/>of cooling increaſed by the hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c. It <hi>is diſtinguiſhed</hi> from an inflamation of the muſcles of the belly, and pleura, by the ſigns mentioned there.</p>

Another <hi>Smal and obſcure,</hi> in which the liver is beſet with ſmal ſwellings and impoſtumations like to felons, with no tumor or paine of the hypochondry, there is a feaver but not much burning, with thirſt and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Another is in the <hi>gibbous part</hi> in difficulty of breathing, which <hi>Paulus</hi> called ſuſpirium irruptum, a cough and heavy paine preſſing the throate are more troubleſom, lying on the right ſide is more difficult, as by which the part affected is preſt; the paine by touching and preſſing growes ſharper. The urine is ſlow, which if it be alſo with content like vetches it ſignifies a colliquation. The Tumor is readily perceived. Somtimes tis prominent and conſpicuous to the Eyes. <hi>'Tis diſſolved</hi> by bleeding at the Noſe if it be of the ſame ſide, with good ſweats, and plenty of Urine. <hi>Things that move <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin,</hi> are far more profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than purging Medicines.</p>
                     <p>Another is in the <hi>Hollow Part,</hi> in which nauſeouſneſs, Thirſt, loathing of meat, the Hickops, Cholerick vomitings or ſtooles are more urgent, lying down on the left ſide is greivous and painful. The Tumor is not readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obvious to the touch. 'Tis diſſolved by ſtooles Cholerick, bloody, by ſweats and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.

                        <hi>A Schirrus of the Liver, is a hard Tumor of the ſame without pain, generated of a thick Humor, impacted in the ſubſtance of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, and hardned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are a Tumor of the <hi>left</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondry, which is diſcoverd by the touch, if the Belly be ſlender and void of Fat, and is eaſier obſerved the Patient ſtanding upright, or bowing to the right ſide, than lying on his back; but tis bounded by the Scituation and Figure of the Liver, and lying on the left ſide, with its bulk it lies on the Stomach and midriffe. An obſcure pain, becauſe the neighbouring parts endewed with ſenſe are compreſt by the Tumor of the Liver, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is explained in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it doth not ſuddenly Cauſe a Tumor but by little and little, for firſt it ſtuffs up the ſmal Veins of the Liver, then being increaſed it redounds to the whol ſubſtance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, afterwards being much more fully heaped up, it diſtends the Liver into a vaſt bulk, that it appeares ſwelled, leaſt of al being dryed, and the thin part diſſipated by force of the heat, al the reſt grows hard.</p>
                     <p>The CURE which is of little Hopes, is orderd.

                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>Beginning</hi> joynd with pain, which is called <hi>Spurious,</hi> and it yeelds to cure. Another <hi>Confirmed, Exquiſite</hi> without pain, which cauſeth a Dropſie, and cannot be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is from a <hi>Cholerick matter,</hi> which is known by this, that Cauſes heaping up a Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick juyce went before, the ſigns of Choler abounding and a hot liver are preſent. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Jaundice, and hath a ſlow Feaver its Companion, and precipitates into a dropſie which is called Aſcites.</p>
                     <p>Another is from <hi>a Flegmatick matter,</hi> in which Cauſes heaping up a thick Juyce went before, there are preſent the ſignes of a Liver cooled, a Cachexy and univerſal Dropſie is Cauſed. The diſeaſe laſts long without any diſcommodity, and if it be turnd to a dropſie, firſt of al it paſſes into a Cachexy, then into a univerſal dropſie.</p>
                     <p>Another is from a <hi>Melancholly matter,</hi> the ſigns of which alſo wil be preſent.</p>

                     <p>Hither belongs <hi>A Tumor of the Liver,</hi> without a Schirrus, which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that it grows in a ſhort time, is leſs reſiſting, the Fingers cannot be thruſt under the ends of the Ribs. It poſſeſſeth only the Membrane that compaſſeth the Liver, yet ſomtimes it fils up the whol Hypochondry. It <hi>ariſeth either</hi> from a viſcous Humor, <hi>either</hi> ſprung from meats of that Nature, <hi>or</hi> made ſuch by cold alteratives given about the time of Evacuation. <hi>Or</hi> from a thin crudity ariſing from meats, drink, and other things inducing cold: or from a thin wind.

                        <item>II. One is in the <hi>Gibbous Part,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by purulent Urins without the ſigns of an exulceration in the bladder, and Kidneys, by difficult breathing, by pain of the midriff. Another in the <hi>hollow part,</hi> which is <hi>known</hi> by the bloody and ſomtimes purulent ſtooles, by the pain of the Guts by reaſon of the acrimony of the matter, by the ſenſe of pricking and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs about the Liver.</item>
                        <item>III.

                        <hi>The weakneſs of the Liver, or atonia, is a hurt of the faculties of the ſame induced by its Cauſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS ought to be taken from the conſideration of the Excrements of the Belly, of the urin, and color of the whol body; as ſhal be manifeſt in the differences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Cauſes</hi> hurting the faculties of the liver, are diſeaſes of diſtemper, whether it be hot or cold; to which is added an external error. viz. when either the chyle is not rightly elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ſtomach, or being wel elaborated, ſomewhat vitious is mixt with it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Cure,</hi> ought to be perfected with things that ſtrengthen the liver, and are appropriate to it, as are <hi>the liver of a wolfe, a calfe, of hens, ſnailes, raiſons &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>As concerning the Differences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One is by reaſon of the <hi>Sanguifying faculty,</hi> which either is hurt by a <hi>cold diſtemper,</hi> or the defect of natural heat; and then the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the belly are like to the waſhings of meat new killed, which the cold growing more intenſe do ceaſe: crudities ariſe, with which the feet firſt, and then the other parts abound, becauſe the veins do ſuffer with the liver ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as being their original. For the cure of this ſerves, <hi>Rupert Cranesbil bruiſed,</hi> a <hi>lie of the pruning of vines</hi> with wine, &amp;c. Or from <hi>a hot diſtemper,</hi> in which the chyle is burnt as it were, the excrements are like to the dreggs of blood &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Another is by reaſon of the <hi>attractive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56003:171"/>and then moiſt things flow down by the ſtool like creame, although there be no fault in the ſtomach, no obſtruction of the meſentery.</p>
                     <p>Another is by reaſon of the <hi>retentive faculty,</hi> and then is rendered by ſtoole things like to the waſhing of fleſh new killed, yet ſeldome moiſt and mattery. &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>The Cauſe</hi> is the fault of nutrition. For though that which is put to the parts, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and adhere, yet by reaſon of the too great plenty of crudities 'tis not aſſimilated. To wit, <hi>the blood is flegmatick, crude and ſerous;</hi> and that is generated ſuch, either by reaſon of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure nouriſhments,</hi> corrupt, and producing abundance of ſerum.

                     <p>The SIGNS are a ſwelling of the Belly, which begins from the lower parts as being moſt diſtant from the heart the fountaine of heat, a ſlenderneſs of the upper parts, the belly being ſtruck a hoarſe ſound as from a bladder half ful: the ſick turning from ſide to ſide a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A Cough ſomtimes either from the compreſſion of the midriffe, or from the peircing of the Water into the breaſt, from whence ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a ſhort time enſues, the impreſſion of the Fingers Leaves behind it a manifeſt mark in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is a watry and ſerous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, whence Dropſie people piſſe little; they that piſſe much after great draufts, are not taken with a Dropſie. And ſome by abſtinence from drink have been reſtored to health. That humor is <hi>collected</hi> if you conſider <hi>the place</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtomach and kidnyes, through which otherwiſe naturally the ſerum is wont to be emptyed: eſpecially in the ſpleen veine, the meſaraick, and perhaps in the branches of the ſpleen artery, and the roots of thoſe veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the hollow parts of the bowels, gaſtrical and epiploical. Whence after quartanes and long continued feavers whoſe cauſe is in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraick veins, a dropſy follows. If <hi>the cauſe,</hi> 'tis collected from too much drink and moiſt meats, by the acceſſion of the fault of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells which either attract, or contein the ſerum, by which it comes to paſs, that it ſtays in the belly, and afterwards is poured forth into its cavity. But it <hi>is poured forth</hi> into the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the belly, or that ſpace which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the peritoneum, the caule and the guts, cheifly by the epiploick and gaſtro epiploick branches: yet ſo as neither the <hi>caul,</hi> which hath veins only from the vena porta, and can eaſily receive the burthen of the meſentary and ſpleen; nor the <hi>pancreas,</hi> which in its middle hath a ſplenicke veine paſſing to the ſpleen with the left branch of the celiacal artery, are free from fault. The humor <hi>poured forth,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be cold, yet becauſe it contains many ſalt parts, and borrows heat from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring parts, 'tis hot alſo, but by continuance of time it putrefies, from whence is raiſed a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the bowels, a Feaver, thirſt, whiles the vapors ſtrike the mouth of the ſtomach.</p>

If impoſtumations or ſpots break forth in the thighs, if being eaſed by remedies 'tis wholly renewed again, becauſe it ſignifies the bowels are corrupt, and poſſeſt either with a ſchirrus, or conſumption and hectick diſtemper.

                     <p>Another is by default of <hi>the Spleen,</hi> which when as it is as it were ſpungy, it ought to draw the water from the ſtomach by the vas breve, that office being delegated to it by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which may be carried from hence by the ſplenick Artery into the Coeliacal, by and by from the trunk of the Aorta by the emulgent Arteries to the veins: It doth that either <hi>too greedily</hi> by reaſon of an inflamation riſen in the Veins, which <hi>is known</hi> by a pertinatious flux of the belly, which doth neither take away the ſwelling of the belly, nor the pain by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Hectical diſtemper, and either from the weakneſs of the veins not attracting the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, or from the corruption of the ſame and continual voiding of Cholerick Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it afflicts with a heat in the jejunum gut and meſentery.

                     <p>The SIGNS are theſe, the Skin appears retcht like the skin of a drum, and ſtruck upon gives the ſound of a Drum, the Navel hangs forth much. The puffing up of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is greater, but the heavineſs leſs. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of it doth not leave behinde it ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous a mark, but the hollow print is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently filled up, belching and Farts often break out, noiſe and rumblings Obmurmurate. It <hi>muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the diſtenſion of the breaſt after wounds,</hi> which doth poſſeſs the breaſt, back, Loins, Cod, Arms, Neck, nay ſomtimes the whol habit. It proceeds from hence, that the Air which ought to paſs ſtreit through the mouth to the Lungs, and from the Lungs again to be breathed forth through the mouth, a way being open between two Muſcles, or the Muſcles and the skin, 'tis blown from the wound as from a pair of bellows into the ſpace between the skin &amp; muſcles: and hence further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it penetrates into the neighbouring parts.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Part Affected</hi> is the Spleen, either according to its Veins and Arteries, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its whol ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are theſe, at the beginning there is Cauſed a heavineſs of the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, &amp; a pain of the ſpleen, from hence a humor mixt with the blood, and diffuſed into the whol body dies it of a Livid color, makes a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing after exerciſe. Poured into the Stomach Cauſeth nauſeouſneſs and vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; into the Guts, a diarrhy. Somtimes by reaſon of its dryneſs it binds the Body.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is an earthy and thick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which oftentimes is collected from a Fenny Air, and groſs meats, and by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Spleen, and interception of the Paſſages cannot be expelled. <hi>Somtimes</hi> 'tis heaped up by reaſon of a hot diſtemper of the Spleen, and the attraction of the Chyle unconcocted, which happens after often lying down on the left ſide, &amp; too much exeriſe. <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> it ſtopps there by reaſon of an accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary flux of the Hemrods intercepted, or the ſuppreſſion of the Courſes.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is ordered as in other obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet note, we muſt have a care of the Cauſes from which it comes; the vomits do good, when as there is a ſtraite way from the Spleen to the ſtomach by the vas breve. <hi>Of Purgers, Poly pody and dodder of time,</hi> with Rayſons, ſenny with cremor Tartar are of Force. <hi>Of openers,</hi> the Flowers of <hi>Broom</hi> and <hi>Saxonia</hi> his electuary <hi>of ſteel</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.

                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are theſe, a Tumor and diſtenſion is perceived with ſome pain, but without the ſenſe of heavineſs and a weight. A murmuring and ſound is made. The Spleen being preſt doth yeild.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are <hi>either</hi> too large drinking of cold water, <hi>or</hi> windy meats, as peaſe, cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, beans, ſcallions. <hi>Or</hi> thick and viſcous humors, which may be overcome by the weak heat and are reſolved into vapors, which doe eaſily puff up the ſpleen, becauſe it is ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> is as in others. The Chymiſts applaud the burning <hi>Spirit of ſaturn</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of ferne, and anoint the region of the ſpleen with the ſame thrice a day, purging in an external cauſe is diſallowed, anointing with oyl of rue, cappers, &amp;c. is ſufficient.</p>

                        <hi>An inflamation of the ſpleen, is the lifting up of the ſame into a tumor, by blood poured forth into its ſubſtance.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are a tumor in the left hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondry, bunching out as it were towards the fore parts, and as it were girting a man in the middle, ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from the paine and inflamation of the left kidney which is higher than the right: there is a pulſation and palpitation of that ſide, by reaſon of the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> with which it abounds, a continual feaver obſerving the periods of a quartan, difficulty of breathing by reaſon of the compreſſion of the midriffe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is blood poured forth and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, which is <hi>either</hi> pure <hi>or</hi> mixt, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its ſelf by its ſigns.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> ought to follow the method of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflamations, ſo that larger drinking after purging be avoided, leaſt the humor be carried to the ſubſtance of the liver.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Aſchirrus of the ſpleen is a hard tumor of the ſame proceeding from a thick, glutinous and a hardened humor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are a reſiſting tumor with an ablong hardneſs in the left ſide, and that without paine; to which are added a difficulty of breathing, a drineſs of the mouth, a ſwelling of the feet, uneaſy lying on the left ſide, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belſome ſwears, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is a thick and glutinous humor, which <hi>either</hi> preſently was ſuch, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from meats of a thick juice, from labors, watchings which do waſte that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the humors. Or afterwards, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thin of it ſelfe, tis hardened either by the force of heat, or by medicines too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing, or by its tartarous nature tending to induration. This diffuſed into the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the blood, makes it livid and colour'd; and leads to a conſumption, becauſe the ſpleen oppreſt is not able to diſcharge its office of ſanguification.</p>
                     <p>The CURE <hi>is more difficult</hi> if the patient have a diarrhy enſue, and a lientery, or water betwixt the skin follow it. <hi>It reſpects</hi> the ſame things as a ſchirrus of the liver. Amongſt <hi>things that diſgeſt</hi> in wardly, are commended, the root of <hi>ferne,</hi> the pouder of <hi>dead nettle</hi> in meats, the wood of tamariske boyled in ſteel water to a third part. <hi>The compoſition of ferne rootes</hi> one ounce; <hi>dodder of vetches</hi> two drams, boyled in eight ounces <hi>of ſtrong wine to the conſumption of a third part.

                           <item>2. <hi>The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages muſt be opened</hi> and the humor prepared by things inceſſive and attenuating, where note that al things are rather to be uſed in a liquid forme, but if in a ſollid, a drauft of liquor muſt be dranke afterwards: we muſt begin with the gentler, and end with the ſtronger. Amongſt thoſe things are, <hi>of ſymples, the roots of ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera, male fern,</hi> the herbs of <hi>fumitory, ſpleen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,</hi> the flowers of <hi>burrage, buglos.</hi> Apples Burſtorfian. <hi>Of compounds,</hi> the ſyrup of <hi>ſweet ſmelling apples, of fumitory,</hi> the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>diacurcuma,</hi> the eſſence of <hi>fumitory, gremander,</hi> &amp;c. of which formerly in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the ſpleen and liver. After theſe, acid waters, baths, ſteele, muſt be given ſpring and autumn, which premiſing the evaccuation of the firſt paſſages, may be given in conſerve of burrage from too ſcruples to one dram and half; upon an empty ſtomach, firſt of al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very third day, til the twentieth, before they are accuſtomed to it, afterwards, a drauft of wine muſt be added, and walking up and down for two hours if they be able; four hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking of it, let them eate their dinner: if they voide not black excrements, we muſt forbear; but if they be wholy ſuppreſt, we muſt move the belly.</item>

In a nidorous crudity things purging choler are beſt, in an acid, purgers of flegme and melancholly, taking meat two hours after that the medicine aſcend not beyond the liver.</item>
                           <item>4. <hi>The vapors fuming up muſt be diverted</hi> from the head and the heart by frictions, glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, cupping-glaſſes, cauſticks, and other medicines, as <hi>elixer proprietatis,</hi> conſerve of <hi>roſes</hi> with ſpirits of ſulphur and vitriol,</item>

                     <p n="2">II.

                        <hi>The ſcurvy is a cachexy ariſing from a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholly humor, corrupted in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, afflicting with a weakneſs of the thighes, ſpots, ſwelling of the gums, and bleeding of them, looſneſs of the teeth, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes.</hi>

                     <p>The SIGNS are put in the definition, and we ſhal treat of them hereafter. To theſe ad <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine and pulſe too much variable, that,</hi> for at the beginning tis thin and yellowiſh the tartarous matter ſubſiſting in it, by and by thick and white: the humors being more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted tis red, and by the admiſtion of an aduſt

Certainly meats hardned with Smoak and Salt, in which there is either little of volatil Salt, or what there was is waſted by Smoaking, ſo that nothing but the fixt Salt and Tartarous remains, a thick Air, and maritine places do conduce to its generation.

                        <hi>The Symptomes,</hi> which afflict the ſcorbuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, are various, which affect for the moſt part by periods, are not al found in al people; ſome are more familiar, others leſs; but they are as follows.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Difficulty of breathing,</hi> and a ſtaitneſs of the breaſt by fits, which affects without a noiſe, hiſſing and cough; ſomtimes it hath joyned with it, a darkneſs caſt over the Eyes, faintings, and the Patients deſpairing of health. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from Vapors or Humors <hi>Sticking</hi> in the Cavity of the Caul, and compreſſing the Midriff, which being ſtirred after vehement exerciſe make the Symptome more greivous. <hi>'Tis Cured</hi> with Thoracical and Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical means, to which add ſomwhat of <hi>Eich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadius</hi> his Confection of <hi>Alchermes, and Saffron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>An Itching, Tumor, and Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gums,</hi> for whenas their fleſh is ſoft and looſe 'tis eaſily corroded by the thinner and ſharper part of the Humor aſcending thither. It cheifly troubles Children, and affects with a blackneſs of the Teeth, Putrefaction and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their holes being poſſeſt with the evil Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, yet it ſuddainly vaniſhes, by reaſon of the recourſe of the Humor. <hi>The Cure</hi> of it is helped by appropiate Waters, if the mouth be waſht with them. By the Decoction of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent plants in auſtere Wine, adding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Vitriol and Alum, which are moſt effectual.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Plenty of ſpots in the Thighs,</hi> which for the moſt part trouble thoſe of ful Age; firſt they are ruddy and like flea-bitings, by and by they become purple and ſomwhat livid, at laſt they decline to a black color. When there is many, Somtimes they invade the breaſt, the Neck, Arms, and Face: ſomtimes they vaniſh ſuddainly, ſomtimes laſt many yeares; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they turne to ſcales; and by how much the more livid they are, by ſo much the more dangerous. <hi>They ariſe</hi> from the deſcending part of the Humor, thruſt by Nature to the more ignoble Parts. They may <hi>be Cured</hi> by things diſcuſſive and mollefying, as Baths <hi>of Juniper berries, creſſes, Scurvy-graſs, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memel, &amp;c.</hi> if they be <hi>ulcerous</hi> they are hardly cured, whenas the whol thigh is gangrend by them.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. A <hi>paine of the thighs,</hi> which is diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, dul, breaking the bones, lying deep, grows Feircer towards night, by reaſon of the motion of the melancholy humor about that time. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from ſerous humors, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falling down from the head, and cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the membranes, ſometimes poured out of the veins from the ſeat of the filth by the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of the vena cava, and inſinuated into the muſcles of the thighs. <hi>'Tis mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> with a cataplaſme <hi>of coagulated milk,</hi> with flowers of chamemel, water creſſes, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper beries boyled in milk. <hi>'Tis exaſperated</hi> by giving of fat things before the ſpots break out.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>A pain of the belly,</hi> which ſomtimes doth ſo goad, that the ſick fal into a rupture of the peritoneum. It troubles by intervalls with a pulſe and urine ſcorbutical. Somtimes it laſts to the fortieth day, neither is it circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with the courſe of the collick gut. And truly with a depreſſion of the belly, that it is pulled inward with the navel, and this ſeems as if it were tyed to the loins; with a diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion felt according to its longitude, a puiling of the right gut upwards, that nothing at al is voided. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from an effuſion of that matter through the meſaraick veins, which do not open into the gutts, between the two coats of the guts. Hence is a diſtenſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, pulling, drawing of the neghbouring parts into conſent, a pregreſſion of Feavers, whoſe Fewel is in the veſſels of the bowels. <hi>It is cured</hi> by removing the cauſe; by mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it by laxatives and glyſters, by which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ought to be provoked. The <hi>elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis</hi> is very profitable.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. A <hi>pain of the feet about the ankles and ſoles,</hi> which is a fore-runner of the ſpots, and by reaſon of the thinneſs of the matter, it doth as it were penetrate the parts. 'Tis cured by a medicine made <hi>of the flowers of elder two handfuls,</hi> boyled in wine, adding two drams <hi>of ſoap,</hi> and applyed on a cloath to the part in pain.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>Pains of the Hypochondries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,</hi> becauſe the wind hath no paſſage out, <hi>Nephritical,</hi> either becauſe the Matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends by the emulgent veſſels to the kidneys: or becauſe being heaped up, and by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an external cauſe, thruſt to the greater veſſels, it flows down to the kidneys. <hi>Of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56003:177"/>Loyns,</hi> which ſometimes ariſe from vitious blood conteined there, ſomtimes by way of a catarrh falling from the head by the veins upon the ſpinal marrow; hence the paines begin from the ſhoulders, and by degrees creep to the Loyns.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Paines of the head,</hi> which trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the evening, and are joined with a certain Feaveriſh heat, which vaniſh away in the morning ſweats; they afflict thoſe principally who contract this evil from the ſuppreſſion of the hemrods. They ariſe from vapors aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither. They require, that <hi>brooklime</hi> be given in a greater doſe, the quantity of hot things be diminiſht, the hypochondries be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with things opening.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. A <hi>Gout,</hi> concerning which note, that it is <hi>wandering,</hi> eſpecially if cold topick medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be applyed; that for the moſt part 'tis joyned, with a light palſey, with a paine cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and returning. That <hi>it ariſeth</hi> from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humors, thin and apt for motion. That 'tis wonderfully <hi>to be obſerved,</hi> that if a live worme be layed upon the place that is fulleſt of paine it skipps, winds and bowes it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, waſts away and dyes. <hi>Amongſt ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> that is appropriate, which is prepared of <hi>the roots of Devils bit</hi> one ounce; <hi>round birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort</hi> three drams; <hi>the herbs of Sage, betony,</hi> each one handful. <hi>Southernwood, Rue, Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkle, Savine,</hi> each one pugil; &amp;c. See <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> concerning the wandring ſcorbutical gout, Tom. 1. of his obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. A <hi>Palſey</hi> which ſomtimes involves the the thighs, ſomtimes al one ſide. It <hi>differs from the palſey of the ancients,</hi> becauſe ſome motion remains, 'tis interrupted, it aſſayles by little and little before it fixes, it follows no ſuch fixt ſtupidity, paines of the colon and belly, tumors breaking forth in any part, and eaſily vaniſhing again. <hi>It ariſeth</hi> from the ſcorbutical matter carried to the ſpinal marrow by that branch which is extended from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orta, not far from the meſenterical branch, and creeps to the back bone and its vertebraes. <hi>'Tis Cured</hi> if the tendons be not rigid, the body being once or twice purged, by the uſe of brooklime and ſcurvy-graſs; if they be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dned and rigid by emollient cataplaſmes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing <hi>fomentations</hi> of water, in which the leaves of Sage, Betony, Roſemary, with el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and melilot Flowers have been boyled.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. A <hi>Convulſion and contraction,</hi> which ſomtimes grows ſo ſtrong, that the ſick are not able to extend any joint, and they are drawn as it were round. <hi>'Tis joined</hi> ſomtimes with a rigidity of the turning joint of the mouth, on which the lower jawe under the place of hearing is reverſed, ſo that the mouth ſhuts cloſe, that it cannot rightly be opened. <hi>It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth</hi> from the rigidneſs of the tendons, when in that tartarous but ſerous humor, this being diſcuſt that is left and dryed. <hi>'Tis cured</hi> by things mollefying and diſcuſſive.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. A <hi>deepe ſleep,</hi> which ſomtimes afflicts, with a ſlow continual Feaver, ſomtimes with an intermitting; it comes with a fit, and that going away it ceaſeth. 'Tis cured with <hi>water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſes</hi> which grows in clear waters.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. A <hi>Palpitation of the heart, and ſwouning.</hi> Concerning which we muſt know that it ſerves for the moſt part, when the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents riſe in their bed the humors being ſtirred; ſomtimes. 'tis ſo great, that they dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly. 'Tis a certain ſign of the ſcurvy, if it afflict in a diſeaſe that is ſmal to the ſenſe. It ought to be oppoſed by medicines given ſix or eight times a day with things antiſcorbuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Vomiting,</hi> which is rather a vaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, 1. To vomit, that hath no heavineſs or pain of the ſtomach going before, it is not taken away by medicines that ſtrengthen the ſtomach, 'tis rather quieted with milky things, that do lenify the humors.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. <hi>Too much ſpitting,</hi> which <hi>ariſeth</hi> partly from vapors raiſed up to the mouth, from the bordering places of the ſtomach; partly from meats corrupted in the ſtomach, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to the mouth along the courſe of the membrane lining the gullet: partly from a ſerous humor poured forth from the ſpleen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtomach through the <hi>Vas breve. 'Tis prevented</hi> by avoiding of ſharp and hot medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which diffuſe the matter.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. <hi>A Flux of the belly both diurnal and nocturnal,</hi> which brings forth compacted excrements, but exceeding the meat in quantity, ſometimes of a green, ſomtimes of an aſh color. It <hi>ariſeth either</hi> becauſe the nouriſhment not attracted by the weakneſs of the liver, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, <hi>or</hi> becauſe the ſerous humor flows back from the ſpleen to the gutts; <hi>or</hi> becauſe the ſerum which might have been diſſipated tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the habit of the body in forme of a vapor by cold condenſing the pores is driven back to the guts, or the veſſels, eſpecially in the morning time, when the body is open with heat, being bound up by cold, 'tis thruſt back towards the greater veſſels, and carries with it to the guts,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56003:177"/>whatſoever it findes in the way: and then <hi>in the cure things aſtringent</hi> are moſt <hi>hurtful.</hi> A dry dyet muſt be uſed; wormwood wine diluted with the decoction of ſuccory is good, <hi>or</hi> becauſe whiles the ſerous humor grows hot with the Feaveriſh heat, and cannot be exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it is turned thither; and then ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive and things of ſuccory are good. 'Tis ſomtimes <hi>bloody</hi> but without paine, and with other ſigns of the ſcurvy. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from Feculent blood abounding in the veins, and poured forth into the guts through the ends of them.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Feavers, which differ far from other Feavers.</hi> For the ſence of cold extends it ſelfe to ſix or ſeaven hours, the pulſe is ſlow, weak, unequal in the declination, great and hard in the vigour, the urine is as we have ſaid formerly. Somtimes they trouble thrice, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four times a day; moſt commonly they are mixt of the type of a continual and tertian. The continual if they be exaſperated by purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicines or hot potions do kil.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>A dropſy</hi> which afflicts both with a harder manifeſt tumor, and diſtenſion of the ſpleen, liver, or belly, and with a greater difficulty of breathing, than otherwiſe, which after the uſe of purgers doth moſt of al torment, and becauſe it proceeds from thick vapors, they being diſcuſt it ceaſeth.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. <hi>An Eryſipelas,</hi> Which ſomtimes moleſts every week, ſomtimes every month, it proceeds from ichorus humors corrupted after a peculiarmanner. In <hi>the cure</hi> the water of elder flowers with Carduus water is good.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> which are dry and yeild no matter or filth, they trouble thoſe moſt that are of a cholerick temperament. They poſſeſs not only the thighs, but other parts alſo: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they become ſo gangrenous, ſo that they feel not iron inflicted on them, they ought <hi>to be cured</hi> without any biting or pain; brooklime alone boyled in drink, layd on them twice a day doth much good, and alſo the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of diapompholygos</hi> in great putrefaction, ſome <hi>Mercury precipitate,</hi> or <hi>ſpirits of vitriol</hi> muſt be mixed with it.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Hard bunchings in the whol body,</hi> &amp; great tumors which ſtick in the groin, the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous parts of the body, like unto muſcles, they are without paine while the patients are quiet, with paine when they walk. If they break forth ſuddainly, and by and by vaniſh they preſage a palſey. A cataplaſme <hi>of the root of the greater comfry, of bryony, wormwood, the crum of white bread</hi> boyled in milk, is commended in the cure.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII.

If it cannot be broken and expeled, it muſt be cut out, concerning which ſee Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions. <hi>For breaking of it</hi> ſerves <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of Salt of white Tartar, one ounce; and Parſty Water, one pound, mixt together, and ſtreined through ſtreining paper, dyed of a yellow color with Orange Pils; alſo the <hi>Pouder of Palmer Worms,</hi> concerning which conſult with the peculiar treatiſe of <hi>Laurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius.</hi> And alſo <hi>the blood of a Goate,</hi> nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht with Plants that break the ſtone, diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, taking at meat thoſe ſtuffings which ought to be made of its Kidneys, and other Bowels and Guts. <hi>For mitigation of the Pain a Bath</hi> is good, which muſt be followed with an unction of the Cod, Pubis, and perinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, with <hi>the Compound Oyl</hi> made of Oyl of Scorpions, bitter Almonds, the Fat of a Cony and Hen, of each one ounce and an half; and the Juyce of Pellitory of the Wal, two drams.</p>
                     <p>There meet us ſome <hi>Differences</hi> of the ſtone.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>ſmal and light,</hi> in which a vagous and wandering tickling afflicts about the pubes and perinaeum, the which is eaſier broken.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>a little bigger,</hi> in which there is felt the weight of ſome heavy thing lying upon it, ſo that going through uneven places is difficult and painful, and dancing much more diffiult, they piſs often, and the Urin can hardly be kept in, which is white, thick, turbid, with a purulent Sediment, or like to the ſnivel of the Noſe; when they ſhould piſs the ſtone driven in the way, the flux of Urin is intercepted, there is a moſt ſharp pain towards the latter end of piſſing, when the ſtone ſtirred up by the Courſe of the Urin, as if it were comming forth, doth more violently compreſs the Sphincter muſcle, at other times it affects the whol paſſage of the Privity, ſomtimes the Nut. Striving to piſs is accompanied with a deſire to go to ſtool, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greatneſs of the ſtone from the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum ſtimulates the right Gut, as wel as the Neck of the Bladder. This can hardly <hi>be Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> any other way than by cutting.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is <hi>concrete,</hi> which ſends no gravel from it in the Urin. Another <hi>not concrete,</hi> in which the Urin doth caſt off ſome gravel and that either white or red, which muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that of the Kidneys, by other ſigns of the ſtone of the Bladder.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. One is which grows in <hi>the bladder it ſelf,</hi> to which that ſaid before accords. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>which deſcends from the Kidneys through the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters into it,</hi> and then ſigns of the ſtone of the Kidneys went before, there was a pain reacht from the Kidneys to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, according to the length of the Ureters, the Nephritical pain is either ceaſed, or troubles little. This ſome do beleeve may be broke by the Indian Plant called by <hi>Manardus, Payco,</hi> and by other things.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. One is <hi>which doth not cleave to the Bladder,</hi> and therefore may be taken forth more ſafely by cutting. Another <hi>which cleaves
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56003:180"/>to the top of the bladder, and hangs down as it were from it,</hi> and then al the ſymptomes reckoned formerly, are more obſcure, there have been thoſe ſeen who have carried it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any paine: nay it can by no meanes almoſt be removed without injury to the patient.

                     <p>
                        <hi>An inflamation of the bladder, doth not ſo much poſſeſs the ſubſtance of the bladder, which is thin and bloudleſs, as the ſphincter muſcle of the neck of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſignes</hi> of it are, a bitter paine in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaeum with redneſs and heat, a ſuppreſſion of the urine with a great endeavoring to piſs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiveneſs of the body (becauſe the right gut is ſtreitned by the greatneſs of the inflamation) a diſtenſion of the pubes and pecten to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel by reaſon of the abundance of water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſe</hi> is the ſame as of other inflamations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cure is difficult,</hi> becauſe the affect is deadly for the moſt part about the ſeventh day eſpecially, a Feaver comming, and the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of urine, and ſtools: yet if it be gentler, and the inflamation being changed into matter, the impoſtumation break inwardly, and is emptied by the urine, there is better hopes: and alſo, an eryſipelas ariſing about the ſuperficies of the skin, and plenty of water being made, ſometimes tis ſuddainly diſſolved. <hi>'Tis ordered</hi> after the manner of other inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Repellers</hi> muſt not be applyed long becauſe the bladder is membranous, and is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound up, the urine ſuppreſt, and the nerves hurt.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A <hi>Scab of the bladder is known</hi> by an itching in the pecten, by the ſtrong ſmel of the urine, by a branny ſediment reſiding at the bottom. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from ſharp and ſalt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors corroding the internal ſuperficies of it. <hi>'Tis cured</hi> in old folks hardly, the humors are partly to be emptyed, partly qualifyed by the four cold ſeeds, violet flowers, ſtrawberries, either taken inwardly, or outwardly injected through the urethra.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. There is no need to ſay what <hi>an ulcer of the bladder is,</hi> it appears from the former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſigns</hi> of it are, ſcales and matter, which flow forth only with the urine, and ſink in it, and ſo 'tis diſtinguiſht from an exulceration of the urinary paſſage, in which the matter and filth, either goes before the urine, or appeares preſently at firſt comming forth, or alſo flows forth without urine. There is a continiual torment about the bladder, pubes, and perenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; the urine alſo is thick, and ſomtimes mixt with matter, ſomtimes with blood, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſes are divers, of which in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The cure</hi> is <hi>of little hopes,</hi> both becauſe the bladder is membranous, and becauſe the urine which is biting by its continual running down, hinders its conſolidation. <hi>'Tis ordered</hi> after the manner of other ulcers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The differences are taken cheifly from the cauſes.</hi>

                     <p>Another is from <hi>ſharp urine,</hi> which the uſe of pure wine and hot meats hath cauſed, and <hi>then</hi> we muſt act with cooling diureticks.</p>
                     <p>Another from <hi>ſharp or ſalt humors, as it were knawing its internal ſuperficies,</hi> and then,

                           <item>1. <hi>We muſt empty</hi> with caſſia and turpentine,</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>We muſt temper them</hi> with water lillies, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, endive, &amp;c.</item>

                     <p>THe <hi>Symptomes of the bladder are, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of the vrine, a diabetes, an Iſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a Strangury, dyſury, bloody piſſing, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Incontinency of the urine, is a ſending forth of the ſame, by reaſon of the reſolution of the ſphincter muſcle, or compreſſion of the bladder, without any ſence of acrimony and paine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the wil of our command.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no need of <hi>Signs</hi> in an affect ſo manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſe</hi> is caſt upon the reſolution of the ſphincter (of whoſe cauſes in the differences) and the compreſſion of the bladder; which comes to paſs, <hi>either</hi> from a convulſion of the muſcles of the belly, <hi>or</hi> from the greatneſs of the young one about the laſt months, <hi>or</hi> from a tumor placed upon the bladder: of al which reſpect muſt be had in the cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cure</hi> varies according to the nature of the Differences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Differences</hi> are taken from the cauſes inducing the reſolution of the ſphincter, and the time.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is from a palſy of <hi>the nerves,</hi> which from the loines are inſerted into it, by reaſon of which it cannot contract it ſelf: and then 'tis harder to be cured, if the ſpinal marrow be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or the muſcle it ſelf wounded. The cauſes by reaſon of which a palſy comes, muſt be inquired from its chapter, and as they vary, ſo the cure muſt be varied.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>only from the laxneſs and ſoftneſs of the ſphincter,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the patients can neither endure the acrimony, nor abundance of urine, when the animal powers are aſleep. For the cure are commended, <hi>Diacyminum, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe</hi> drunk in wine; <hi>the throat of a cock,</hi> roſted and dryed, that it may be ground to a pouder, given at night in aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent red wine. <hi>The bladder of a goat</hi> dryed in an oven and poudered given likewiſe one dram weight.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One alſo <hi>is diurnal,</hi> which afflicts the apoplectical and paralytick.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Nocturnal,</hi> which is wont to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to children, by reaſon of the cold and moiſt diſtemper of the muſcle, or not thinking of it: in ſucceeding yeares, the muſcle of the bladder growing dryer and ſtronger it ceaſes.

                     <p>The <hi>Part affected</hi> is the kidnies, yet ſo, that the bladder alſo oppreſt with the plenty of urine, conſents.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are plentiful piſſing, little or not at al changed, a ſtrong thirſt, nor any ſatisfaction from the taking in of any liquor, a paine, pracking, and heavineſs about the loins, a coliquation of the whole body, the belly dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and withered.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is controverted amongſt phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, we hold 'tis the intenſe attractive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the kidnies, ariſing from a very hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of them, which is cauſed by an afflux of ſharp and biting humors, viz. choller and ſalt flegme, impacted in the ſubſtance of the kidnies: the too great largeneſs of the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent veſſels and ureters, the heate of the liver, peſtilential feavers, the weakneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs retentive faculty, doe help. Thus when the kidnies draw plenty of ſerum from the veins, and cannot contain it by reaſon of their weakneſs, they ſend it to the bladder, the veins again draw from the liver, this from the ſtomach, whence the orifice of this being emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and dryed, there ariſeth a continual thirſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> is <hi>too difficult,</hi> and for the moſt part paſſeth into a hectick, and dryneſs of the whole body. <hi>'Tis ordered.</hi> 1.

                     <p>As Concerning the <hi>Differences,</hi> 'tis only one.</p>

                     <p>The Diſeaſes of the Cod are, <hi>Inflamation, Excoriation, Wounds, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, and Rupture.</hi> Of them there is no need to ſay any thing. <hi>An Excoriation</hi> is often Cauſed by the Urin, the upper Skin being corroded, and 'tis Cured by ſprinkling of Pompholyx, or dryed Myrtle finely poudered, ſearced, and mixt with Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe or Myrrh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Rupture of the Cod is a Tumor of the ſame, ariſing either from the cauſe falling down into it, or from wind or water collected there, or a maſſe of Fleſh generated there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Species</hi> of it are four, if you conſider <hi>the Differences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>windy,</hi> or a Pneumatocele, which <hi>is known</hi> from hence, that the Cod, ſomtimes alſo the ſtones is very much diſtended without a weight &amp; heavineſs; the wind is felt if the Cod be preſt with the hands, and is removed from place to place w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a noiſe. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from winds, which are either collected there, <hi>or</hi> tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the neighbouring Guts and Belly: and 'tis moſt familiar with Children. <hi>'Tis Cured</hi> (premiſing univerſals) by things diſcuſſing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and inwardly applied. <hi>A Cataplaſm</hi> of Bay-berries, the flower of Beans and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek, with Bran, the pouder of Cummin ſeed, ammoniacum, turpentine, oxymel, and oyl of bays mixt together is good.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Another is <hi>watry,</hi> or a hydrocele, which <hi>is known</hi> becauſe there is perceived a waving, the cod appeares as it were ſhining; the tumor alwaies continues at the ſame bigneſs, neither doth it go up into the belly by preſſing it. <hi>It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth</hi> from water, which for the moſt part flows thither from the belly, for thoſe cauſes which are mentioned in the dropſy. <hi>It is cured,</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. <hi>By prohibition</hi> that the watery humor be not generated, or flow thither, of which ſee the differences.</item>

<list>
                                 <item>1.

                                 <item>2. One is <hi>with a dropſy,</hi> and then the cure muſt be directed againſt the dropſy; Another <hi>without a Dropſy,</hi> in which although there is not ſuch great plenty of water, that it can raiſe up the belly into a tumor, that there is ſomwhat of it collected in the cavity of the belly, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the parts, eſpecially an external cauſe being added, as ſtriking &amp;c. The tumor <hi>either</hi> poſſeſſes the whol cod, <hi>or</hi> only one ſide; and <hi>then</hi> the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ſticks in the erythroidal membrane that conteines the ſtone. The right ſtone never, alwaies the left ſwels. <hi>Or</hi> the fault is in the <hi>left kidny,</hi> through which when the ſerum can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcend, it fals through the ſeminal veine proceeding from the emulgent of the left kidny, into the erythroidal coate; from the cure of which we muſt either abſtaine, or the cod muſt be opened only in the lower part. <hi>Or</hi> it is not, and then the cod muſt be cut in the upper part neer the groin, that both the humor may be emptyed, and the afflux of more through the skar of the erythroidal coate be hindred. See <hi>Frabricius</hi> his obſervations.</item>
                                 <item>3. One is when <hi>the water is conteined between the erythroidal coat, and the darton,</hi> in which the tumor is rounder, like an egge, the ſtone is hidden from the ſight and touch, the cod it ſelf is more white and is diſtended little or nothing: another is, when <hi>'tis out of that betwixt it and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent skins,</hi> in which the ſtone is to be felt, the cod is more diſtended.</item>

                     <p n="3">III. Another is <hi>a fleſhy rupture</hi> or a Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele, in which ſomthing fleſhy is bred: It <hi>is known</hi> by a hard tumor, increaſed by little and little, afflicting without a tumor of the groine, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the guts; 'tis for the moſt part in the right ſtone becauſe nature doth moſt comodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly caſt off the blood to the ſtones by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal veine iſſuing from the cava. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from an impurer blood flowing to the teſticles and cod, by degrees dropping from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the veſſels, and changed by nature that is never idle, into a ſubſtance like unto fleſh. <hi>'Tis cured,</hi> 1. <hi>By repreſſion</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers and dryers, the pouder of the root of Reſt-harrow is commended, 2. <hi>By cutting,</hi> of which ſee Authors. <hi>'Tis divided</hi> into a <hi>ſcirrous one,</hi> in which there is neither pain nor heat; <hi>and a malignant one,</hi> in which there is felt a prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Another is <hi>various,</hi> or a Cirſocele, in which the veſſels nouriſhing the ſtones are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated like to varices. <hi>'Tis known</hi> by this, that the veins are ſweld, and wreathed and rounded like ſhootes of vines, the tumor is oblique and rowled up like a grape; ſpring and autum, the the guts being diſtended with wind, or the feet cooled, a pain accompanies it. It <hi>ariſeth</hi> from a thick melancholy humor poured into the veſſels. 'Tis hardly cured, things drying, and hanging the ſtones in a truſs are good.

To inhibit the paine, <hi>Steeled milk</hi> caſt in doth good. For drying, <hi>baths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are various.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Some are from <hi>external cauſes,</hi> as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, hard labor, violent copulation. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>internal,</hi> as are the ſecundine corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the flux of blood retained, the flux of the womb, a virulent gonorrhaea, the french pox, Inflamation. Humors flowing thither, either from the whole, or a part, or generated there; al which muſt be attended in the cure.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Some are <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> from which little matter flows, and medicins may be layed upon them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>profound,</hi> which are in a contrary way, and the medicines ought to be injected.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Some are <hi>Milde</hi> with little matter, thick, not ſtinking, in which both the gentler abſterſives, as honey of roſes with barly water, whey with ſugar or the decoction of lentils, and the more benigne aſtringents take place. Others <hi>ſordid</hi> with plenty of matter, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with paine, in which we muſt act with ſtronger things. <hi>The mundifyer of ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi> in Caſtro l. 2. c. 29. is here commended. Others are <hi>eating</hi> with a colored matter, green livid, ſtinking, flowing forth with paine, in which <hi>aloes and wormwood</hi> amongſt mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difers are the cheife.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Some are called <hi>Phagades,</hi> which are ſmal and longe ulcers, eating the skin of the necke of the womb. <hi>They are known</hi> both by the paine and blood cauſed in copulation; and by ſight, if the neck be looked into; and they are like unto them, which in winter time are wont to riſe in our hands. <hi>They ariſe</hi> many waies.

                           <item>1. <hi>Externally,</hi> from a painful labour, violent copulation, and then we muſt uſe an aſtringent glyſter.</item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Internally</hi> from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, condylomata, an afflux of ſharpe humors, which muſt firſt be taken away by purgers, before we come to topick medicines.

                        </list>
Others which <hi>leave behinde them a Fyſtula,</hi> which is voide of paine, unleſs it come to a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous part, ſometimes it paſſes to the bladder and right gut, and the excrements are caſt forth through it. If it be ancient it ought to be left to a palliative cure; in which at fit ſeaſons the body is purged, but the callus which is alwaies joyn'd with it, if that be curable, after drying of the part, being molefied by vulnerary poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt be waſted, either by cutting or burning.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An inflation of the womb is a diſtenſion of the ſame by wind produced out of a cold, fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and flatulent matter, by default of a weak heat.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis called alſo <hi>a windy Mola,</hi> by reaſon of the falſe hopes of a conception.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſigns</hi> are a diſtenſion of the womb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the region of the belly, which is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times increaſed, ſomtimes diminiſht; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis extended to the ſides, ſomtimes to the navil, loins and midriffe. <hi>It is diſtinguiſht</hi> from <hi>a dropſy</hi> by its leſſer bulk, want of thirſt, by the increaſing and decreaſing of the tumor, by a leſs waſting of the upper parts. From <hi>a dropſy of the womb</hi> by the foregoing of cauſes generating wind, by a noiſe, leſs heavineſs, greater diſtenſion, by feeling an extenſive and pricking pain in the neighboring parts. From <hi>an inflamation of the guts,</hi> becauſe here neither are pains, nor coſtiveneſs of body; becauſe the courſes are ſtopt, the feet and hollow of the eyes do ſwel, and color of the body is changed becauſe the woman pants, is greived, and when ſhe wakes out of her ſleep, breaths with her neck upright. From <hi>a mola,</hi> by the want of heavineſs and hardneſs, in the belly with a weight, moving it ſelf from ſide to ſide, when they move. From <hi>a conception</hi> by the ſound, and increaſe and decreaſe of the tumor, by wanting of motion like to the moving of the infant, for if the belly be preſt ſtrongly, the wind being driven to the neighboring parts, a certaine beating motion is felt in the whol belly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſe</hi> is expreſt in the definition, the matter it ſelf is <hi>either</hi> generated in the womb it ſelf. Either by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of the courſes; or by interception of the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after a delivery; <hi>or</hi> proceeds from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, either by the veins, or by the feed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>But the weakneſs of heat</hi> ariſeth for the moſt part from the external aire ſtopping by its coldneſs thoſe impurities in women lying in, which ſeek a paſſage forth; from hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, abortion, ſtoppage of the courſes, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>The cure</hi> if you conſider the method, differs not from the cure of other inflamations, ſo we have reſpect to the part. <hi>Obſerve</hi> that amongſt purgers, <hi>Species hierae and diaphenicon with caſtor,</hi> are commended. For ſuffumigation, <hi>Nutmeg,</hi> of which <hi>Hartman</hi> in his chymiatry; for plaiſters, <hi>the plaiſter of bay berries</hi> with treacle; for drinks, <hi>nutmeg</hi> bruiſed, boyled with the roots of feverfew and drank with ſix ounces of wine, two drams of Sugar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Differences</hi> are taken from the part it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>One is <hi>when the wind is in the cavity,</hi> and then the mouth of the womb is ſo cloſedup, that none of it can get forth, when either the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is moved or her belly per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t with the hand, a ſound and noiſe is perceived. But <hi>that it may be conteined in the cavity</hi> is certain, both becauſe the womb may be diſtended though it be thick, as in conception, and be retained there as in a mola; and becauſe the altering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive faculties being never idle, do change the diſeaſed ſeed into wind.</p>
                     <p>Another, <hi>when 'tis in the coats of the ſame,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the mouth of the womb may be open, by reaſon that the winde is concluded in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row place, the ſound goes forth and the pains are greater and extended further: the evil is more difficult to cure, than that in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>

                        <hi>An inflamation of the womb is a tumor of the ſame from the putrefaction of blood fallen into its ſubſtance, troubleſom with many ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and ſomtimes turning to a ſcirrbus, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to an impoſtumation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſigns,</hi> are various, the tumor it ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the region of the womb, with a heat and pain, a ſhutting up of the womb, drawing of it towards the inward parts: but the whol neck of it appeares ruddy, little veins ſwelling every where with blood like to a ſpiders webb. There is a difficulty of breathing, which ſhew a pleureſy, becauſe the outward coat of the womb being extended which ariſeth from the peritoneum and is faſtened to it, thoſe parts alſo to which it coheres, are diſtended. The excrements of the belly and bladder, by reaſon of the heat and dryneſs of the belly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the paſſages, are detained. The bulk of the belly ſomtimes appeares empty, and the belly is filled with water, and the navil ſtrutts forth, and the mouth is ſlender, and of a ſuddain a few and evil courſes follow. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and burning Feaver afflicts, by reaſon of the conſent of the womb with the heart by arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and great veſſels, ſomtimes a lypirias by the motion of the humors towards the inward parts. There is a pain of the breaſts with an inflation of them by reaſon of the conſent of the groins, the hipps, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife, the cannel bones, the forepart of the head which is extended to the roots of the eyes; and it ariſeth from vapors of blood putrefying, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to the head by the arteries, which run through the neck from both parts of that called the infundibulum into the fore part of the head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cauſe</hi> is blood, which ſomtimes is pure, ſomtimes mixt with choler, ſomtimes dyed with black choler. <hi>It ſlides thither</hi> or ſlides forth for common cauſes, viz. the detaining of it in the time of the courſes, or after a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the occurſion of the cold air. <hi>'Tis at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted</hi> by heat or pain which is cauſed, <hi>either</hi> by abortion, hard labor, violent drawing forth of the ſecundine, long walking when the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are at hand, <hi>or</hi> by a troubleſom carrying, if the young one be either great, or ill placed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cure is difficult,</hi> eſpecially if the whol womb be poſſeſt or ſuppurated; for a ſordid ulcer ariſing from thence, doth at length kil the patient with a ſlow Feaver. <hi>None at al,</hi> if there be an eryſipelas, becauſe the young one it ſelf dies by reaſon of the exceeding heat, whence follows abortion which kils the mother. If it turne to a deadly gangreen. <hi>'Tis cured</hi> as in other inflamations, where note that for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion we muſt not open a veine in the leggs, when as theſe veins draw the blood to the womb, but in the arme, when as the blood flows from the liver, and the veins adjacent to it. For derivation, a veine in the ham may be opened, unleſs the patient be great with child, leaſt abortion be cauſed. Topicks ought to be applyed cooling and moiſtning without any aſtriction. 'Tis thought that the <hi>decoction of mother of time prepared with ſteeled water,</hi> and outwardly applyed with ſponges, doth ſtop it by a certain propriety.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken from the part it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>of the whol womb,</hi> in which the ſymptomes afore mentiond do evidently afflict, and few indeed do ſcape. Another is <hi>of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide,</hi> in which the heat paſſes to the hipp, by reaſon of the ligaments of the womb which are carried thither, the legg of the ſame ſide is hardly moved, the groins of that place are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is <hi>of the hinder part,</hi> in which the belly is bound, the paine doth more afflict the loins and backbone. Another <hi>of the fore part,</hi> in which becauſe it coheres to the bladder, the urine is ſtoppt or made with difficulty, the pain goes more towards the pubes. Another of <hi>its bottom,</hi> in which the lower part of the belly is ſo pained, that it cannot endure to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the pain is extended more to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. There is one <hi>which turns to a ſcirrhus,</hi> in which al things become milder, a weight and heavineſs is felt in the neighboring parts, the evil is of long continuance, and is often termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in a dropſy of the womb. Another to <hi>an impoſthumation,</hi> in which al things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, til ſuppuration is made: horrors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order invade them for the moſt part about the evening; the impoſtumation being broke (but it breaks either into the cavity of the womb, which is ſafer, or 'tis poured Forth into other parts) ſomtimes the urine, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the belly is ſtopt, with a ſwelling of the pubes, and the ſenſe of ſomthing waving.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſcirrhus of the womb is a hard ſwelling of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56003:190"/>the ſame, and reſiſting without pain, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from a thick, earthy, and faeculent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are beſides other general ones, to wit the Courſes at the beginning are ſuppreſt, or flow too little; the evil increaſing, there is a great flux of blood by intervals, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Mouths of the Veins being opened more than is fit, or the Womb not being able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive or retain the accuſtomary quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood. <hi>'Tis diſtinguiſht</hi> from a Mola, becauſe in this if the Courſes flow, they flow diſorderly, and the Breaſts alſo ſwel with Milk, which in a Scirrus are extenuated, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is an earthy and feculent humor, to wit a thick blood, ſomtimes fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, ſomtimes Melancholical, which happens in the declining Age, and troubles them which have been ſick of a Pica, Malacia, or bulimus; oftentimes from an inflamation ill cured, by reaſon of the too much uſe either of coolers, or diſcuſſives.</p>
                     <p>The CURE is <hi>difficult</hi> both becauſe things dryed a long time cannot be mollefied, and becauſe the Native heat is exhauſted in parts affected with a Scirrus, and becauſe while the Humor is mollefied, it may eaſily turn to a Cancer by taking putrefaction. <hi>The proceedings</hi> of the cure differs not from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>divided</hi> in reſpect to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>is in the ſubſtance it ſelf,</hi> in which the Womb lies upon the Hip and Back, and there Cauſeth a pain. Another <hi>in the Neck,</hi> which is diſcovered by the touch of the finger, 'tis eaſier cured than the former. If it be in the upper part of the Neck; the Woman is hurt in Copulation, and the bladder is preſt by the Tumor, if it be in the lower part, the right Gut is offended.</p>

                        <hi>A Dropſie of the Womb is an impotency of the ſame from water collected in it, either by its own fault, or the fault of other Parts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are a looſe ſwelling of the lower part of the belly, extended according to the figure of the Womb a ſcarceneſs and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Courſes, becauſe they are like to the waſhings of fleſh, their failing before the time, the thinneſs and moiſture of the mouth of the Womb, ſoftneſs of the Breaſts, and want of milk, a rigour and oftentimes a Faver. <hi>'Tis diſtinguiſht</hi> from <hi>an Inflamation</hi> by want of a Feaver, and by its ſoftneſs, by other Symptomes, of which formerly. From an inflation, by defect of diſtenſion and noiſe. From a <hi>Mola,</hi> becauſe in this a greater weight is felt in the bottom of the belly, the breaſts at the time of the birth approaching do ſwel. From a <hi>Conception</hi> becauſe in a Dropſie the Tumor of the Womb is extended according to the largeneſs of the womb and belly, inconcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 'tis pointed. In women with Child the Courſes do not flow, here a certain bloody Humor, evil flows forth obſerving no order, and is quickly ſtopt. From <hi>a Dropſie of the Belly,</hi> by the Patients color in the Face, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Liver be affected, by want of thirſt, by the aſcent of the Tumor from the lower part to the upper.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is the water there, either <hi>by the fault</hi> of the Spleen or Liver, of which conſult with their proper Chapters; or <hi>by the weakneſs</hi> of the Womb it ſelf, by reaſon of which, it doth neither concoct wel, nor wel expel its Excrements, the which is, <hi>either</hi> from often abortions, and hard labour. <hi>Or</hi> from too great a Flux of the Courſes, diſſipating its heat. <hi>Or</hi> from the ſuppreſſion of them choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the ſame heat.</p>
                     <p>The CURE requires the bringing forth of the water, and ſtrengthing of the Womb, having reſpect to the Cauſes, <hi>Hartman,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Antimonial Pills.</hi>

                     <p>One is <hi>when the water is collected in its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> in which the Orifice of the womb if it be touched, is found ſhut up, the Tumor is great, and a certain waving is perceived if it follow conception, that yellowiſh and ſtinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within two months for the moſt part kils the Young one, which is then caſt forth with it.

                        <hi>The falling down of the womb is a hanging forth of the ſame out of the belly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56003:190"/>from a ſolution of the unity of its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments.</hi>

                     <p>The general <hi>Signs</hi> are, a pain of the Loyns, of the lower part of the belly, of the Privities, of the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> to which the Womb is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, and this at the beginning.

                     <p>The CURE is <hi>difficult,</hi> if it be great, if it afflict thoſe of ful Age, if a Feaver, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or other Symptomes happen.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A weakneſs of the womb is a ſluggiſhneſs or defect of the ſame, in performing its actions, induced by the fault of a diſtemper, occult qualities, and the native heat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are, a languiſhing deſire of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, an inordinate flux of the Courſes, when they are at hand, a pain in the loyns and pecten, little or no pleaſure in copulation, often aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a breaking forth of wind from the womb. For the actions of the womb are, a deſire of Venery, a voiding of menſtruous blood at due times, the ejection of ſeed in the act of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the retaining of that received from the man, a keeping of the young one conceived to the due time, and the excluſion of it when 'tis perfect into the world.</p>

                     <p>One is from <hi>the diſtemper of the womb,</hi> which if it be <hi>Cold</hi> the womb cannot perfect a mean quantity of nouriſhment, therefore it heaps not up many Excrements. If <hi>moiſt,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the blood, nor ſeed, nor young one are rightly conteined. See the Cure above.</p>
                     <p>Another is from <hi>occult qualities,</hi> which the womb hath is apparent from hence, becauſe it hath a ſingular Sympathy and antipathy with divers things; deſires mans ſeed, is delighted with ſweet things, &amp;c. And then the affect riſeth from no evident Cauſe. There is found no exceſs of moiſture or coldneſs. <hi>In the cure</hi> Medicines muſt be applyed that are proper by their whol ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Another is from <hi>the innate heat, either choaked, or diſſipated,</hi> and then the affect is dangerous, becauſe the heat is difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. <hi>In the Cure</hi> we muſt act with reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, as are, Cinnamon, Nut-Megs, the Species Diaxyloaloes, Aromaticum Roſatum, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſuppreſſion of the Courſes is a retention of the menſtruous blood, by reaſon of the ſtreit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the paſſages, or the fault of the blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are afforded from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the woman her ſelf, but if they wil not confeſs, In <hi>Virgins 'tis known</hi> by this, that the blood ſtopt doth wander up and down in the Veins, and cauſe obſtructions, changes the colour of the body, induceth a Feaver, &amp;c. In <hi>women</hi> that 'tis carried to the womb and infers Diſeaſes of the womb. <hi>'Tis diſtinguiſht from the retention in childing,</hi> becauſe they with Child are little changed in the affections of their mind, they retaine the Native color of their body, they find the Symptomes dayly more mild, they perceive the motion and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the infant the third month. They have the mouth of their womb ſhut up and hard.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSES are a ſtreightneſs of the veins, and the fault of the blood, of which in the differences ſhal be treated more at large.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure muſt be haſtened</hi> becauſe that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion doth produce many diſeaſes, as a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a leucophlegmatick, a dropſie, vomiting of blood, &amp;c. <hi>'Tis difficult</hi> if it be of long continuance, if it hath exceeded the ſixth month for the moſt part 'tis thought incurable, eſpecially if it happen from a perverſion of the neck of the womb, for then the woman ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and vomits flegme, the parts of the belly and pecten are pained, the back bone, and a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens.

                        <hi>The diſcolouring of the courſes is a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, when as they ought to be ruddy; to a palneſs, whiteneſs, greeneſs, yellowneſs, or lividneſs, by default of blood.</hi>

                        <hi>The ſigns</hi> are afforded from beholding the blood it ſelf, there is added a ſtinkingneſs, an inordinate evacuation, and oftentimes erratick Feavers, accute; horror, loathing of meat, pains of the ſtomach &amp;c. concerning which ſee <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

                        <hi>The cauſe</hi> is layd upon the falt of the blood, concerning which; as alſo of its cauſes, ſee in the differences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The cure</hi> attends the cauſes, therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of them it varies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>'Tis divided</hi> twofold.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. One is <hi>when the blood contracts a fault,</hi> either by reaſon of a diſtemper of the whol bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or of ſome principal part, reſpect to which muſt be had in the cure.</p>
                     <p>Another, <hi>when the blood is in fault,</hi> either becauſe 'tis ſuppreſt and retaind, and <hi>then</hi> a ſtoppage of the courſes went before, pains are felt in the breaſt, and ſtrong pulſations; if the habit be better, the courſes break forth, and the blood flows forth, and a ſtrong ſmelling matter, about the eight or ninth day. <hi>Or</hi> becauſe 'tis polluted by the womb abounding with excrements, and then there are ſigns of a polluted womb.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>when the blood is polluted by the mixture of excrementitious humors,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> if you conſider the cure, we muſt prepare them, but ſo, that when as thick humors do want at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation, and things too much attenuating do melt the ſerous humors, and move them to the womb, we muſt abſteine from the ſtronger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beware of vinegar; we muſt empty &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. One is <hi>when the courſes decline to a whiteneſs,</hi> which <hi>ariſeth</hi> either <hi>from flegm,</hi> of which howſoever it be there are ſigns of a weak ſtomach; or <hi>from matter,</hi> and <hi>then either</hi> ulcers are raiſed in the womb and barrenneſs follows, <hi>or</hi> the courſes flow forth for ſeven or eight days and the woman is freed; <hi>or</hi> the ſame break forth at the parts above the groin without a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and about the hypochondries they come forth and the woman ſeldom ſurvives. Or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome daies a great tumor riſeth upon the groin, ruddy without a head, becauſe there the fleſh is filled up, and 'tis hardly opened.</p>
                     <p>Another is <hi>when it declines to yellowneſs or greenneſs,</hi> which proceeds from choler.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis called the <hi>womans,</hi> becauſe it affects women, and truly virgins alſo, when as the cauſes take place in them, and there are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it. Yet more commonly thoſe of <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age,</hi> eſpecially if they be indewed with a moiſt and cold conſtitution, do lead a delicate and idle life, and feed upon cold and moiſt nouriſhments: <hi>old women alſo,</hi> and that unto death, by reaſon of the plenty of flegm, and the weakneſs of the concocting faculty.</p>
                     <p>There is no need to enquire <hi>the Signs,</hi> the affect is made known by the relation of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient her ſelf.

From a nocturnal <hi>polution,</hi> becauſe this is joyned with a phanſie of a venereal buſineſs, and happens only in the ſleep. From the <hi>diſcolored courſes,</hi> becauſe they obſerve their periods, though not alwaies exactly; they do not happen to women with child, and thoſe troubled with the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, they ſhew a red colour. From <hi>matter out of the ulcers of the womb,</hi> becauſe then the ſigns of an ulcer ſtand forth, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf is thicker and whiter.

                     <p>We have laid <hi>the Cauſe</hi> upon an Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Humor, which Somtimes is raiſed by purging Medicines, Nature being ſtirred up by their uſe to attempt excretions, ſomtimes by Baths, Nature caſting off by this way thoſe Excrements which could not be driven forth by ſweat.</p>

Hence though at the beginning 'tis ſcarce Cured, yet afterwards 'tis more difficult. For the whol body accuſtomes it ſelf to caſt off the Excrements through that way, and the womb being rendered weaker collects Excrements. It varies according to the nature of the Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken from the part that ſends them, and the colour of the blood.</p>

                     <p>THe Symptoms more familiar to thoſe that live unmarried are, <hi>the Virgins diſeaſe, the ſuffocation of the womb, the madneſs of the womb, and the melancholy of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                        <hi>The Virgins diſeaſe (otherwiſe the white, the Virgins, the Pale, the Lovers Feaver) is a change of the natural color in the Face into a greeniſh and pale, proceeding from the abundance of crude Humors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis called <hi>the Virgins,</hi> becauſe it appertains moſt of al to Virgins, and truly to the Fairer, endued with a white colour, thence the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from crude Humors is the eaſier.</p>
                     <p>The Face it ſelf wil afford us <hi>the Signs,</hi> to which add other Symptomes, as the pain of the Head, ſomtimes madneſs, the Humors and Vapors being carried thither and mixt with Melancholy; a difficulty of breathing with a palpitation of the heart, if they ſtir, with a ſmal and frequent pulſe of the Arteries in the Neck, back, and Temples, by Reaſon of the lifting up of Vapors from the heating of the thick blood, inordinate and erratick Feavers by reaſon of the Putrefaction of the Humors, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold affects of the Stomach, amongſt which loathing of meat, by reaſon of the unhappy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Chyle. A Pica from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of evil humors in the coats of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Vomiting from the great plenty of crude Humors, both a diſtenſion of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondries, from the reflux of the Menſtruous blood to the greater Veſſels and a rumbling from the tumultuation of wind. A ſwelling as wel of the whol body with a laxneſs and ſoftneſs from the plenty of the Humor, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Eye-lids, eſpecially in the morning after ſleep, when in the night the heat hath raiſed more Vapors and ſerour Humors than could be diſcuſſed; or of the Legs and Feet, eſpecially about the Ankles from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſerous Humors.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56003:195"/>
                     <p>The CAUSE is the crudity and plenty of Humors, ariſing either from the ſuppreſſion of the Courſes, or from the Native ſtraitneſs of the Veſſels, or from that acquired by eating of wheat, Loom, Chalk, earth, Nut-Meg, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Vineger, &amp;c. Or from the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other bowels. For the Menſtruous blood, the Paſſages not being open, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitate to the greater Veins and Bowels, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Veſſels, and over whelms the heat. Hence ariſeth evil concoction in the Bowels, and the Humors are carried to the habit of the body.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Suffocation of the womb is a heap of Symptomes oppoſing ſomtimes the natural actions, ſomtimes the Animal, ſomtimes and more often the vital, by periods, joyned with a coldneſs of the whol Body, proceeding from a malignant Vapor raiſed from the womb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis called alſo <hi>the Suffocation of women, the ſtrangling from the womb, the Hyſterical paſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The SIGNS are either <hi>of that at hand,</hi> a wearinneſs of the whol body, with a weakneſs of the Legs, a paleneſs of the Face with a ſad look, a nauſeouſneſs which is ſeldome ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vomiting, oftentimes a certain weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, and loathing of meat, and that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a murmuring and rumbling of the belly, ſomtimes without theſe. Or <hi>of that preſent,</hi> in which a Vapor raiſed up to the heart, and ſtopping the vital ſpirits, a ſmal fainting away is Cauſed, the Pulſe is changed a little, the body grows cold, the ſpirits recurring to the heart, fear and deſperation moves the patients; the ſame thruſt to the Head and Jaws, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Jaws are bound up, and the Patient ſeems to be ſuffocated. The motion of the breaſt and Midriffe is hindered the Animal ſpirits being ſtopt, and breathing is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, the ſick living in the mean while by Tranſpiration; ſomtimes a madneſs of the womb is added with prating, and fury, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times other kinds of madneſs ariſe. Somtimes ſleep and a drowſie Diſeaſe is induced, in which the woman falling as aſtoniſht, lies without motion, without ſenſe, with ſuch ſmal breathing that ſhe ſeems dead. Or <hi>of the fit declining,</hi> and then a certain Humor flows forth from the Privities, the Guts murmur; by and by the Eyes are lift up, the Cheeks grow red, ſence and motion return. Somtimes a coldneſs at the time ſlides from the Head by the Neck into the ſhoulder and Arme, which makes motion difficult, but preſently 'tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt. Yet al theſe Signs do not happen in al. There have been thoſe who were troubled with continual laughing the Vapor inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf into the Membranes of the Breaſt; there have been thoſe who ſeemed to frame the hiſſing of Serpents, the croking of Crows, &amp;c. According to the proportion of the paſſages and breath breaking forth. <hi>It differs from an Epilepſie,</hi> becauſe in this the Convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more univerſal, they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe things after the fits which happened to them in the fits, the Pulſe is greater than before, a foam flows about their Mouth. <hi>From an Apoplexy,</hi> becauſe in this the fit is ſuddain without any notice; a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſnoaring afflicts them in breathing, there is ſo great a reſolution of the Parts, that though they be prickt yet they do not feel. <hi>From a Syncope,</hi> becauſe there are no preſages in this of the fit to come, the pulſe failes to the ſence, cold ſweats afflict, it vaniſheth in a ſhort time, when as the Hyſterical paſſion laſts ſomtimes a day or two. <hi>From the dead,</hi> they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht by Sneezing, Cauſed by Sneezers and other means.</p>
                     <p>The CAUSE is a malignant Vapor, thin and ſpirituous, in one moment penetrating the whol body, and raiſed from the matter corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after a peculiar manner in the womb, and ſtirred either of it ſelf or by external things, as things ſweet-ſmelling, fear, Anger; and aſcending upwards not only by the Veins and Arteries, but alſo by occult paſſages.

                     <p>The CURE <hi>is ſomtimes of doubtful hopes,</hi> If it long afflict old women, becauſe it infers an impeachment of the ſtrength, and ſhews a

If it happen to breeding women, a hard labour or abortion going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; if it aſſaile great bellied women, becauſe it ſtrikes a feare of abortion; <hi>of better hopes,</hi> if breathing be not hurt too much, if the fits do not return often. <hi>It reſpects.</hi>

                  <p>Another is <hi>of the Caul or Epiplomphalos, when the Caul ſlides into the Navel,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that the Tumor in one pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Another is <hi>watery or Hydrophalos, when the Navel is lift up into a Tumor by water,</hi> which <hi>is known</hi> by this, that the Tumor is lax, and if it be preſt, 'tis neither increaſed, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that 'tis joyned with a waving, and holding a Candle to it, it appears clear and perſpicuous.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>windy, when wind diſtends the Navel,</hi> which is known by this, that the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is ſoft, yeilds to the Finger, gives a ſound like a drum, and let the Patient lie which way he wil it is not changed.

                  <hi>An Appendix.</hi> Concerning the Gout.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>An arthritis is a pain of the parts about the joints, cauſed by a defluxion of a ſerous and ſharp humor, poured forth of the veins and arteries into them, aſſailing by periods, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined with it an hinderance of motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſubject</hi> is the membranous parts, and thoſe endued with ſenſe about the joints, from which neither are the membranous ligaments excluded. The pain is cauſed more in them, both becauſe the humors are thruſt thither from the veins and arteries, and becauſe being carried thither they are in leſs room.</p>
               <p>The SIGNS are almoſt evident by the relation of the Patient, at firſt aſſault the pain invades the great Toe, and for the moſt part of the left Foot, afterwards a Tumor, heat and redneſs is manifeſtly perceived; there is added an impotency to move, and in an Arthritis of long continuance hard Knobs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The CAUSE is a ſolution of unity indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>by a ſerous, Salt, and ſharp Humor,</hi> this ariſeth from the uſe of nouriſhments, as plants, Carpes, unwholſom wines, by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a vitious conſtitution of the bowels, as of the Liver and Spleen, <hi>the efficient Cauſe of that Salt or Tartar.</hi> It oftentimes comes neer to the Nature <hi>of ſpirits</hi> which have a moſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Salt in them, whence it often wanders up and down. By reaſon of the want of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeparation <hi>'tis mixt with the blood.</hi> By <hi>the veins and arteries</hi> 'tis ſent to the <hi>joints,</hi> whence when the fit is at hand, the veſſels which lead to the hands and feet, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to the utmoſt joints, do ſwel, by reaſon of their weakneſs, either natural from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or acquired, by labor, exceſs of the air, and other things altering the joints, from whence they become ſofter and more relaxt, nature being ſtimulated by its plenty, disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening it ſelf, and ſomtimes being helpt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes, as the ſpring or autume aire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mind, the retention of accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſweating &amp;c. 'tis moved to <hi>the joints rather</hi> than to other parts, perhaps becauſe the ligaments and tendons are nouriſht with a more terreſtrial blood, and that hath affinity with the tartarous humor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> CURE is in general <hi>moſt difficult,</hi> both by reaſon of the diſeaſe it ſelf in reſpect of errors in dyer, and other things, &amp; by reaſon of the fit, becauſe the humors diſperſed through the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, membranes, and nerves, by reaſon of thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; coldneſs of thoſe parts, are hardly diſcuſt. <hi>None at al</hi> if any deadly diſeaſe be joined with it. If there be a luxation, for though the joint may be reduced, yet the ligaments remaine relaxt; if in the luxation, the cavity of the joint be filled with a tophous matter, becauſe before that is taken away, the joint cannot be reduced; that cannot be taken away, if it be hereditary.

This ought not to be ſtopt ſuddainly, if it be neither plentiful, nor the Infants bear it not ill; but if it happen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, we muſt clenſe firſt with a Clyſter, or Syrup of Roſes ſolutive with aſtriction.

            <head>The Vertues, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and variety of Operations of the True and Phylopſohical <hi>AURUM POTABILE,</hi> Attained by the Studies of Doctor <hi>Freeman,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Culpeper,</hi> and left with his Widdow, and adminiſtred by a Phyſitian in her Houſe neer <hi>London,</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of Spittle-fields, next door to the Red Lyon.</head>

               <hi>The Vertues are as follow:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT Cures al Agues, whether Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan: as alſo it cuted divers people of that moſt horrid putrid Feaver, which ſo violently ſeized on mens Bodies (both before and after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1653.) to the great admiration of many; and when the parties Diſeaſed have been both ſenceleſs and ſpeechleſs, for that neither that, nor any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of <hi>Panacaea,</hi> though never ſo gentle, could ſafely be adminiſtred into the Body, it hath beyond al Hopes, by external Application on the ſtomach revived them. It cures the Gout of all ſorts perfectly being adminiſtred as the Phyſitian ſhal adviſe. It cauſeth Women ſubject to Abottion, or Miſcarriage, to go their time: and yet being given when the time comes it cauſeth a ſpeedy and eaſie delivery. It is an infallible cure for the French Pox, and doth it with ſuch caſe, ſpeed, and Secretneſs, that none of the neareſt relation ſhal take notice thereof. It Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es the Green-ſickneſs and al ſorts of Jaundce, It provokes the Terms. It is good for Aches and all afflictions coming of cold. It helps the Bickets. But to what purpoſe do I nominate diſeaſes in particular, when it is an univerſal Remedy for al Diſeaſes being adminiſtred as the Phyſitian ſhal adviſe? For its chief aim is exhilarating the vital Spirits and Heart. It both binds and ſtops fluxes, yet Purges; it both Vomits, and ſtays Vomiting; it cauſes Sweat, yet cures preternatural ſweatings, and performs al its Operations as Nature it ſelf would have it, becauſe it only fortifies her in her Centre.</p>
            <p>To conclude, It is an Univerſal Fortification for al Complexions and Ages, againſt al ſorts and degrees of Peſtilential and contagious Infection, both preventing before their poſſeſſion, and extirpating of them after it.</p>
